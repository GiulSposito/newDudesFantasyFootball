## Matchups Recap

### Three Is the Magic Number, as Paulinia Robots Handles Limeira Dead Rabbits 

With the trio of Travis Kelce, Najee Harris, and Patrick Mahomes leading the charge, Paulinia Robots humiliated Limeira Dead Rabbits 139.56 to 66.90. That threesome joined forces to score 90.56 points, surpassing the total of Limeira Dead Rabbits. Kelce scored three touchdowns, accounting for 35.50 points (115 Rec Yds, 3 TD). Meanwhile, Harris delivered two touchdowns (27.60 points) and Mahomes passed for 329 yards (27.46 points). Kelce also recorded the second-highest point total in the league this week, with Harris tallying his highest point total of the season. The 72.66-point win for Paulinia Robots was the fifth-biggest in the league this year. Adding insult to injury, Limeira Dead Rabbits got zero points from J.D. McKissic. Paulinia Robots (9-2, 1,400.60 points) climbs into first place, while Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-7, 1,027.72 points) drops to 11th place.

 Dameon Pierce had plenty of chances for Paulinia Robots, but he logged just 17 total yards on 12 touches.

 Since Kelce was the top point-getter for Paulinia Robots, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 26.04 points, Justin Fields paced the squad in Week 8, while Patrick Mahomes (34.14 points) was tops in Week 9 and Christian Kirk (31.50 points) in Week 10.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Sorocaba Wild Mules was savvy enough to pick winners in real football, as well. Among all of their starters, Dalvin Cook is the only one that suited up on a losing NFL team this past week. Prescott has now led Sorocaba Wild Mules in scoring twice in the past four weeks, joining Dalvin Cook, the team's leading scorer in Week 9 (with 13.60 points) and Week 10 (with 23.60 points).

### Behind Three Big Performances, Indaiatuba Riders Picks Up Victory over Limeira Jetsons 

The triumvirate of Tony Pollard, Davante Adams, and Brett Maher led the charge, as Indaiatuba Riders defeated Limeira Jetsons 150.72 to 108.80. That threesome combined to tally 92.00 points, topping the production from the top scorers from Limeira Jetsons (Jamaal Williams, Tee Higgins, and Justin Herbert), who totaled 67.90 points. Pollard scored two touchdowns, accounting for 36.90 points (80 Rsh Yds, 109 Rec Yds, 2 Rec TD).

Indaiatuba Riders (6-5, 1,255.80 points) climbs into seventh place, while Limeira Jetsons (6-5, 1,261.54 points) drops to eighth place.

### Amparo Bikers Humiliates London Knights, Moves to 9th Place 

Amparo Bikers got 25.42 points from Jimmy Garoppolo (228 Pas Yds, 4 TD), trashing London Knights 120.22 to 68.26. Amparo Bikers took a 3.24-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. The beating was the third blowout loss of the year for London Knights. Amparo Bikers (4-7) sits just two games back of London Knights (6-5), they can be confident in their 1,204.10 to 1,016.76 season points lead.

 There was one important starter on Amparo Bikers that failed to capitalize on opportunites. Even though Tyler Boyd saw a total of seven targets, he only reeled in two catches.

 Since Garoppolo was the top point-getter for Amparo Bikers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 30.60 points, Jaylen Waddle paced the squad in Week 8, while Austin Ekeler (24.10 points) was tops in Week 9 and Amon-Ra St. Brown (22.10 points) in Week 10.

 Amparo Bikers takes on Indaiatuba Blues (2-9, 1,175.96) in Week 12, while London Knights matches up with Rio Claro Farmers (7-4, 1,229.00).

### Rio Claro Farmers Squeaks By Sorocaba Steelers, Seizes Career Series Lead 6-4 

Rio Claro Farmers got 17.70 points from Devin Singletary (86 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) and 17.00 from the New England Patriots DEF (3 PA, 1 TD, 4 Sack), edging Sorocaba Steelers 98.76 to 96.46. This close call was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago. Derrick Henry led Sorocaba Steelers with 25.36 points (87 Rsh Yds, 45 Rec Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Pas TD) while George Pickens brought in 18.30 (83 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Sorocaba Steelers (8-3, 1,219.64 points) drops to fourth place and Rio Claro Farmers (7-4, 1,229.00 points) remains in fifth place.

 For Rio Claro Farmers, Rondale Moore wasn't just the lone wide receiver to earn a negative score; he was the only starter throughout the whole league in negative territory. Kareem Hunt probably deserved more touches for Sorocaba Steelers, as he put up an efficient 54 all-purpose yards on just seven total touches.

 Rio Claro Farmers was very lucky that Sorocaba Steelers's best WR had his bye week, since George Pickens only managed 18.30 points. If Tyreek Hill (22.23 points per game this year) was active and scored his average, Rio Claro Farmers would've lost by 1.63 points. Since Singletary was the top point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 42.80 points, Alvin Kamara paced the squad in Week 8, while the Patriots Defense (24.00 points) was tops in Week 9 and Saquon Barkley (23.00 points) last week.

 In Week 12, Rio Claro Farmers takes on London Knights (6-5, 1,016.76), while Sorocaba Steelers matches up with Limeira Jetsons (6-5, 1,261.54).

### Powered by Their Big Three, Goncalves Miners Goes Crazy on Indaiatuba Pats 

Spearheaded by the triple threat of Amari Cooper, Joe Burrow, and George Kittle, Goncalves Miners humiliated Indaiatuba Pats 162.50 to 86.92. That threesome combined to score 82.40 points, significantly more than the top scorers from Indaiatuba Pats (Justin Fields, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Aaron Jones), who totaled 50.82 points. Cooper scored two touchdowns, accumulating 31.30 points (113 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Meanwhile, Burrow put up four passing touchdowns (26.70 points) and Kittle scored two touchdowns (24.40 points). Also, Cooper recorded his highest point total of the season. Goncalves Miners had the top score of the week, as well as the fourth-largest margin of victory in the league this season. Goncalves Miners (9-2, 1,355.12 points) climbs into second place, while Indaiatuba Pats (8-3, 1,331.38 points) drops to third place.

 Jones had plenty of opportunities for Indaiatuba Pats, but could only manage 60 total yards on 18 touches.

 While Justin Jefferson led Goncalves Miners in Week 10 with 35.30 points, Cooper paved the way this week with 31.30.

 In Week 12, Goncalves Miners takes on Indaiatuba Riders (6-5, 1,255.80), while Indaiatuba Pats goes up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-7, 1,027.72).

### Barao Butchers Gets Win over Campinas Giants, Takes Career Series Lead 2-1 

Ryan Tannehill passed for 333 yards (19.02 points) and Jonathan Taylor added 16.40 points as Barao Butchers defeated Campinas Giants 111.02 to 99.46. This matchup included three lead changes, with the largest lead being 15.76 points after Sunday night. Campinas Giants has lost their last six in a row. Adding insult to injury, Campinas Giants had a starter score zero points (Graham Gano). Campinas Giants (2-9, 1,073.34 points) sinks into last place and Barao Butchers (4-7, 1,062.16 points) remains in 10th place.

 James Conner had plenty of chances for Barao Butchers, but he logged just 54 total yards on 16 touches.

 Since Tannehill was the high scorer for Barao Butchers, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the last six weeks. With 28.10 points, Deon Jackson paced the squad in Week 6, while Raheem Mostert (20.90 points) was team-leader in Week 7 and DK Metcalf (17.50 points) led the way in Week 8. Tom Brady (15.20 points) was tops in Week 9 and Jonathan Taylor (24.30 points) led in Week 10.

 Barao Butchers will meet first-place Paulinia Robots (9-2, 1,400.60) next week. Campinas Giants plays Sorocaba Wild Mules (2-9, 1,071.02).
