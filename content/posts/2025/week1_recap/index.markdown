## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Comes Back to Shellac Sorocaba Wild Mules, Avenges Previous Loss 

Paulinia Robots was clutch under the lights of prime time with 47.76 points on Sunday Night Football (40% of their total score) to dominate Sorocaba Wild Mules 118.06 to 82.44. The late heroics were somewhat unexpected, since they were originally projected to score 36.32 points on Sunday night. Paulinia Robots was led by Josh Allen (394 Pas Yds, 30 Rsh Yds, 2 Pas TD, 2 Rsh TD). Allen passed for 394 yards and contributed 38.76 points in the blowout. Paulinia Robots (1-0) starts the season in third place, while Sorocaba Wild Mules (0-1) begins in 15th place.

 On Paulinia Robots, the Baltimore Ravens DEF wasn't just the one DEF to post a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the entire league in the negatives. De'Von Achane ultimately deserved more touches for Sorocaba Wild Mules, as he put up an efficient 75 all-purpose yards on just 10 total touches.

 In Week 2, Paulinia Robots squares off against Indaiatuba Riders (1-0, 109.12), while Sorocaba Wild Mules faces Amparo Bikers (0-1, 106.28).

Indaiatuba Riders came into the Sunday night game facing a 12.50-point deficit, but scored 14.80 for the comeback victory. This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands four times, with the largest lead being 20.40 points after Thursday. Jayden Daniels led BroncosLoucura with 20.12 points (233 Pas Yds, 68 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) while Saquon Barkley brought in 18.40 (60 Rsh Yds, 1 TD).

Indaiatuba Riders starts off the season in fifth place, while BroncosLoucura starts out in ninth place.

 There was one glaring player on Indaiatuba Riders that missed out on some chances. Despite being targeted seven times, Brian Thomas Jr. could only reel in one catch.

### Niners BH Comes from Behind to Squeak By London Knights 

Niners BH (1-0) stole one from London Knights (0-1) 107.22 to 103.02 led by Patrick Mahomes (258 Pas Yds, 57 Rsh Yds, 1 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) with 26.02 points and Dylan Sampson (29 Rsh Yds, 64 Rec Yds), who scored 17.30. Niners BH came into the Sunday games already in front 34.02 to 9.90. They surrendered that lead after the late Sunday games and were losing 103.02 to 93.72. Niners BH secured the comeback victory on Monday night, thanks to 8.50 points from Jordan Mason during the Vikings/Bears game.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities. On the winning side, Ashton Jeanty got 21 touches but only tallied 40 total yards, while Chase Brown managed just 51 yards on 23 touches for London Knights.

 It wasn't all bad news for London Knights, as they did field a team of real-life winners. Every starter except Jameson Williams played for an NFL team that won this past week.

 Niners BH plays Indaiatuba Blues (1-0, 72.80) next week, while London Knights gets Barao Butchers (0-1, 84.92).

### Campinas Giants Steals Win from Limeira Jetsons 

Campinas Giants had an excellent primetime showing with 49.30 points on Sunday Night Football (41% of their total score) to steal the win from Limeira Jetsons 118.88 to 106.32. The late heroics were especially impressive, as they were originally projected to put up just 26.19 points on Sunday night. Campinas Giants was led by Zay Flowers, who contributed 28.10 points to the cause (143 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Campinas Giants (1-0) kicks off the campaign in second place, while Limeira Jetsons (0-1) begins in 10th place.

 James Conner had plenty of chances for Campinas Giants, but he logged just 44 total yards on 16 touches. A spot where Limeira Jetsons really made a regrettable decision is quarterback. Justin Fields could have started in place of Trevor Lawrence, and that point difference would have been enough to secure the victory.

 Next week, Campinas Giants plays Holambra Dutch (0-1, 70.12), while Limeira Jetsons battles Limeira Dead Rabbits (0-1, 103.02).

### Indaiatuba Blues Gets By Holambra Dutch 

Indaiatuba Blues got 16.50 points from Breece Hall (107 Rsh Yds, 38 Rec Yds) and 14.80 from Justin Jefferson (44 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to nip Holambra Dutch 72.80 to 70.12. This close win was revenge for a loss to Holambra Dutch in their last meeting a season ago. Holambra Dutch was led by Malik Nabers with 12.10 points (71 Rec Yds) and the Chicago Bears DEF, who scored 11.00 (27 PA, 1 TD, 3 Sack, 1 Int). The margin could have been larger as Indaiatuba Blues won despite two starters scoring zero points. Indaiatuba Blues kicks off the campaign in eighth place, while Holambra Dutch starts out in the cellar.

 RJ Harvey ultimately deserved more touches for Holambra Dutch, as he put up a whopping 70 total yards on just seven touches.

 Indaiatuba Blues takes on Niners BH (1-0, 107.22) in Week 2, while Holambra Dutch battles Campinas Giants (1-0, 118.88).
