Paulinia Robots got 20.10 points from Breece Hall (116 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) and 19.62 from Patrick Mahomes (338 Pas Yds, 2 TD/2 Int) to shred London Knights 109.22 to 61.24.

### Behind a Sizzling Showing from Ja'Marr Chase, Limeira Dead Rabbits Gets Win Against Sorocaba Wild Mules

 There was one starter on Limeira Dead Rabbits that missed out on some opportunities. Despite being targeted nine times, Romeo Doubs could manage just four catches.

 Since Chase was the top point-getter for Limeira Dead Rabbits, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 28.90 points, Mark Andrews paced the squad in Week 3, while J.K. Dobbins (22.30 points) was tops in Week 4 and Jalen Hurts (27.66 points) last week.

### Goncalves Miners Gets Win over Amparo Bikers, Makes It Four in a Row 

A rally on Monday Night Football (43.70 points, 39% of their total score) wasn't enough for Amparo Bikers, as Goncalves Miners earned the 127.20 to 111.24 victory. The late-match efforts were a little unexpected, considering their original Monday projection was only 32.27 points. Goncalves Miners was led by Joe Burrow (300 Pas Yds, 25 Rsh Yds, 3 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD). Burrow passed for 300 yards and added 32.50 points to the cause. Goncalves Miners (5-1, 683.66 points) climbs into third place, while Amparo Bikers (2-4, 657.90 points) steps into ninth place.

 Along with being the one defense to tally a negative score, the Jacksonville Jaguars DEF (on Amparo Bikers) represented the lone starter in the whole league in the red. Ekeler had lots of opportunities for Amparo Bikers, but could manage just 83 total yards on 24 touches.

 Since Burrow was the top point-getter for Goncalves Miners, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 23.10 points, Amari Cooper paced the squad in Week 3, while Josh Jacobs (34.50 points) was tops in Week 4 and Justin Jefferson (30.32 points) in Week 5. Also, with 24 touches this week for Austin Ekeler, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 7, Goncalves Miners takes on Rio Claro Farmers (5-1, 719.36), while Amparo Bikers battles Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-2, 661.16).

### Sorocaba Steelers Embarrasses Indaiatuba Blues, Streak Now at Three 

The duo of Tyreek Hill and JuJu Smith-Schuster carried the team, as Sorocaba Steelers dismantled Indaiatuba Blues 103.50 to 72.06. That tandem combined to register 52.00 points, significantly outperforming Josh Allen and Cooper Kupp (43.06 combined points), the top two on Indaiatuba Blues. Hill racked up 177 yards, adding 29.70 points (177 Rec Yds). Smith-Schuster also chipped in 22.30 points (113 Rec Yds, 1 TD) for the winners. This beatdown was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Blues in their last meeting a season ago. Sorocaba Steelers started one player with zero points while Indaiatuba Blues also served up one goose egg, meaning both sides missed scoring opportunities. Sorocaba Steelers (4-2, 632.80 points) climbs into fifth place and Indaiatuba Blues (1-5, 720.50 points) stays in 12th place.

### Rio Claro Farmers Beats Limeira Jetsons, Claims 2nd Place 

Rio Claro Farmers registered the highest point total this week to take down Limeira Jetsons 127.30 to 107.42. Rio Claro Farmers took a 67.20-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to Limeira Jetsons in their last meeting a season ago. Alec Pierce (acquired via free agency in Week 5) made a big impact, posting 13.90 points. Rio Claro Farmers (5-1, 719.36 points) climbs into second place and Limeira Jetsons (4-2, 699.74 points) drops to sixth place.

 There was one player on Rio Claro Farmers that left points out on the field. Despite being targeted seven times, Alec Pierce could manage just three catches.

 Since Barkley was the top point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 39.42 points, Lamar Jackson paced the squad in Week 3, while Marquise Brown (20.80 points) was tops in Week 4 and Alvin Kamara (23.40 points) last week.

### Indaiatuba Pats Beats Barao Butchers, Fighting Past Strong Outings by a Couple of Indianapolis Colts 

The top performances by a dynamic duo of Indianapolis Colts (Deon Jackson and Michael Pittman) weren't enough, as Indaiatuba Pats got a victory over Barao Butchers 124.02 to 102.96. That tandem teamed up to tally 54.50 points in defeat. Jackson (42 Rsh Yds, 79 Rec Yds, 1 TD) led the way with 28.10 points, while Pittman (134 Rec Yds) pitched in with 26.40. Also, Rhamondre Stevenson recorded his highest point total of the season. Adding insult to injury, Barao Butchers got zero points from Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Indaiatuba Pats (4-2, 681.74 points) climbs into fourth place, while Barao Butchers (1-5, 561.82 points) stays in 13th place.

 Barao Butchers had one notable starter that left points out on the field. Even though DK Metcalf saw a total of seven targets, he only reeled in two catches.

 Since Stevenson was the leading point-getter for Indaiatuba Pats, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 32.00 points, Aaron Jones paced the squad in Week 2, while A.J. Brown put up 19.50 points to lead the way in Week 3. Jared Goff (33.22 points) was tops in Week 4 and Gabe Davis (32.10 points) led last week.

 Next week, Indaiatuba Pats meets Sorocaba Wild Mules (0-6, 571.40), the last-place team in the league. Barao Butchers gets Indaiatuba Riders (3-3, 656.04).
