Limeira Jetsons got zero points from Tee Higgins, which might have made the difference in the outcome.

 Darrell Henderson ultimately deserved more touches for Limeira Jetsons, as he put up a whopping 30 total yards on just four touches. There are a couple of spots where Limeira Jetsons wishes they could get a do-over, as Kenneth Walker III could have started in place of Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Geno Smith in place of Justin Herbert. Either of those point differentials would've been enough to change the outcome.

### Sorocaba Steelers Beats London Knights 

Sorocaba Steelers got past London Knights, who labored to score points this week, 89.68 to 80.58. Sorocaba Steelers took a 39.80-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup.
