## Matchups Recap

### Goncalves Miners Beats Paulinia Robots, Claims 12th Place 

Goncalves Miners beat Paulinia Robots, who labored to score points this week, 87.40 to 83.30. This win was revenge for a loss to Paulinia Robots in their last meeting a season ago. Nyheim Hines led Paulinia Robots with 20.80 points (74 Rsh Yds, 34 Rec Yds, 1 TD) while Brandin Cooks brought in 11.60 (56 Rec Yds). The result might have been even worse as Goncalves Miners had a starter score zero points (Robert Tonyan). Goncalves Miners (2-7, 928.90 points) climbs into 12th place and Paulinia Robots (4-5, 1,103.66 points) drops to 10th place.

 There was one fairly noticeable player on Goncalves Miners that let some chances slip through his hands. Despite being targeted seven times, Adam Thielen could only manage two catches.

 While Adam Thielen led Goncalves Miners last week with 19.80 points, Cousins paved the way this week with 21.58.

 Next week, Goncalves Miners plays Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-2, 1,043.76), while Paulinia Robots faces Campinas Giants (5-4, 982.14).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Pulverizes Sorocaba Steelers, Tacks On 3rd Consecutive Win 

Sorocaba Wild Mules logged the highest score of the week to crush Sorocaba Steelers 132.34 to 88.46. Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 9.74-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. This beatdown was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago. Sorocaba Steelers actually averages more per game in losses (98.94) than wins (93.44). Devonta Freeman (acquired via free agency in Week 9) and Devontae Booker (acquired via free agency in Week 9) made a big impact, posting 16.30 and 15.20 points, respectively. Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-4, 1,101.24 points) climbs into sixth place and Sorocaba Steelers (1-8, 884.94 points) stays mired in last place.

 Along with being the one D to earn a negative score, the Cincinnati Bengals DEF (on Sorocaba Steelers) represented the lone starter in the whole league to do so.

 Since Herbert was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Wild Mules, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 21.00 points, Aaron Jones paced the squad in Week 6, while Joe Burrow (26.64 points) was tops in Week 7 and Chris Godwin (28.00 points) in Week 8. Also, with 10 targets this week for Robert Woods, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Sorocaba Wild Mules takes on London Knights (2-7, 1,093.14) in Week 10, while Sorocaba Steelers gets Amparo Bikers (5-4, 1,022.10).

 Since Brown was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 30.70 points, Leonard Fournette paced the squad in Week 6, while the Buccaneers Defense (21.00 points) was tops in Week 7 and Patrick Mahomes (14.00 points) last week.

### Rio Claro Farmers Grinds Out Win Against Indaiatuba Pats, Makes It Three in a Row 

Rio Claro Farmers picked up 24.18 points from Carson Wentz (272 Pas Yds, 3 TD) and 17.50 from Melvin Gordon (80 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) to edge Indaiatuba Pats 97.38 to 93.84.

Indaiatuba Pats (4-5, 994.48 points) drops to 11th place and Rio Claro Farmers (5-4, 1,102.30 points) remains in eighth place.

 Kenyan Drake ultimately deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Pats, as he put up a whopping 100 total yards on just 10 touches.

 Rio Claro Farmers got pretty lucky that Indaiatuba Pats's top QB had the week off, since Jimmy Garoppolo only managed 19.34 points. If Tom Brady (25.24 points per game this year) had suited up and hit his average, Rio Claro Farmers would've been beaten by 2.36 points. While Mike Evans led Rio Claro Farmers in Week 7 (with 31.60 points) and DK Metcalf last week (22.30 points), Wentz has now been the team's top point-getter twice in the last four matches.

### Barao Butchers Pulls Off Comeback over London Knights to Grab 7th Place 

This week's second- and third-highest-scoring teams met in a shootout as Barao Butchers overcame a 16.82-point deficit on Monday night to slip by London Knights 124.64 to 119.96. London Knights falls to 2-7 (13th place), pushing their losing streak to three. London Knights actually finished with more total yards (856 to 719), despite coming up short on the scoreboard. James Conner (96 Rsh Yds, 77 Rec Yds, 2 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD) accumulated the highest point total in the league this week (40.30) and Hunter Renfrow scored 17.90 points to lead Barao Butchers. Jonathan Taylor (172 Rsh Yds, 28 Rec Yds, 2 TD) amassed the second-highest score of the week (34.00) and Nick Chubb scored 30.30 points for London Knights.

 Najee Harris had plenty of chances for Barao Butchers, but he logged just 78 total yards on 25 touches.

 It wasn't all bad news for London Knights, as they did start two of the league's top-five overall RBs this week. Since Conner was the top point-getter for Barao Butchers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 24.70 points, Najee Harris paced the squad in Week 6, while Derek Carr (19.02 points) was tops in Week 7 and Ryan Tannehill (21.20 points) in Week 8.

 Barao Butchers gets a challenge in Week 10 when they go up against Indaiatuba Blues (5-4, 1,125.32), who averages a league-leading 125.04 points per game. London Knights gets Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-4, 1,101.24).

Mixon went off for 28.00 points in a 23.12-point win for Limeira Jetsons. He scored two touchdowns as part of his huge game (64 Rsh Yds, 46 Rec Yds, 2 TD).

### Campinas Giants Brings Down Indaiatuba Blues for 3rd Straight Win 

A primetime rally on Sunday Night Football (29.70 points, 35% of their total score) wasn't enough for Indaiatuba Blues, as Campinas Giants pulled out the 115.84 to 83.88 victory. The late efforts were ultimately a little underwhelming, as their original Sunday night projection was 39.25 points. Campinas Giants was led by Lamar Jackson (266 Pas Yds, 120 Rsh Yds, 3 TD/2 Int). The Baltimore QB passed for three touchdowns and contributed 30.64 points to the effort. Campinas Giants (5-4, 982.14 points) climbs into fourth place, while Indaiatuba Blues (5-4, 1,125.32 points) drops to ninth place.

 There was one starter on Indaiatuba Blues that missed out on some opportunities. Even though A.J. Brown saw a total of 11 targets, he reeled in just five catches.

 Since Jackson was the top point-getter for Campinas Giants, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 19.50 points, Mike Gesicki paced the squad in Week 6, while Alvin Kamara (33.90 points) was tops in Week 7 and Michael Pittman (30.60 points) in Week 8.
