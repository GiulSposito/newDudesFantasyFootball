### Indaiatuba Riders Rallies Against Limeira Dead Rabbits, Moves Up to 2nd Place 

This week's second- and third-highest-scoring teams met in an epic battle as Indaiatuba Riders came back to defeat Limeira Dead Rabbits 147.96 to 135.26. This is the most a team has scored this season without getting a victory. Limeira Dead Rabbits falls to 10-3 (1st place) and snaps a three-game winning streak. Indaiatuba Riders (9-4) is in second place, averaging 116.84 points per game. With the victory, Indaiatuba Riders clinches a playoff berth this week. The score from Indaiatuba Riders was unexpected given that they were only expected to score 110.53 points. Limeira Dead Rabbits scored 122.0% of their projected 110.90. George Kittle (181 Rec Yds, 2 TD) registered the highest score this week (39.60) and Javonte Williams scored 29.80 points to lead Indaiatuba Riders. Keenan Allen (34 Rec Yds, 2 TD) got 22.40 points for Limeira Dead Rabbits.

 Damien Harris probably deserved more touches for Limeira Dead Rabbits, as he put up a whopping 111 total yards on just 10 touches.

 Since Kittle was the leading point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 20.60 points, Marquise Brown paced the squad in Week 9, while Patrick Mahomes put up 36.24 points to lead the way in Week 10. Dalvin Cook (22.50 points) was tops in Week 11 and Leonard Fournette (44.10 points) led in Week 12. It wasn't all bad news for Limeira Dead Rabbits, as they did field a team of real-life winners. Every starter except Courtland Sutton suited up for an NFL team that won in Week 13. Also, with 19 touches this week for Austin Ekeler, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 14, Indaiatuba Riders will face Indaiatuba Pats (6-7, 1,432.08). Limeira Dead Rabbits takes on Sorocaba Steelers (4-9, 1,292.30).

Amparo Bikers had scoring issues this week and lost to Campinas Giants 94.32 to 67.00. This win was revenge for a loss to Amparo Bikers in their last meeting a season ago. Amparo Bikers, already one of the lowest-scoring teams in the league this season, scored just 59% of their 112.64 season average. Campinas Giants (6-7, 1,283.78 points) climbs into 10th place and Amparo Bikers (7-6, 1,464.36 points) stays in fifth place.

This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands three times, with the largest lead being the final margin. This win was revenge for a loss to Goncalves Miners in their last meeting a season ago. The Pittsburgh QB (acquired via free agency in Week 10) and Cordarrelle Patterson (acquired via free agency in Week 10) made a big impact, posting 19.34 and 12.60 points, respectively. Sorocaba Steelers (4-9, 1,292.30 points) climbs into 13th place and Goncalves Miners (3-10, 1,327.62 points) sinks into the cellar.

 Gaskin had plenty of opportunities for Goncalves Miners, but could only manage 49 total yards on 17 touches.

 Since Higgins was the leading point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has now led the team in each of the past eight weeks. Also, with 11 targets this week for Jaylen Waddle, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Next week, Sorocaba Steelers will face top-ranked Limeira Dead Rabbits (10-3, 1,519.42). Goncalves Miners plays London Knights (5-8, 1,542.68), who is averaging a strong 118.67 points per game.
