### Indaiatuba Riders Wins Against Barao Butchers, Streak Climbs to Four 

Indaiatuba Riders picked up 21.00 points from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers DEF (3 PA, 4 Sack, 3 Int, 2 Fum) and 19.00 from Marquise Brown (80 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to take down Barao Butchers 115.74 to 94.62. Indaiatuba Riders took a 51.34-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. This win was revenge for a loss to Barao Butchers in their last meeting a season ago. Allen Lazard (acquired via free agency in Week 7) and Devonta Freeman (acquired via free agency in Week 7) made a big impact, posting 17.00 and 12.90 points, respectively. Indaiatuba Riders (5-2, 871.22 points) climbs into second place and Barao Butchers (3-4, 779.22 points) stays in eighth place.

 Each side had starters that failed to capitalize on opportunities. On Barao Butchers, for example, Calvin Ridley was targeted 10 times but could reel in just four of them. For Indaiatuba Riders, Marquise Brown and Robby Anderson combined to catch eight balls on 23 total targets.

 Since the Buccaneers Defense was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 31.72 points, Patrick Mahomes paced the squad in Week 4, while Marquise Brown (33.50 points) was tops in Week 5 and Leonard Fournette (30.70 points) in Week 6.

### Limeira Dead Rabbits Gets Victory over Amparo Bikers for 7th Consecutive Win 

A rally on both Sunday Night Football and Monday Night Football wasn't enough for Amparo Bikers. They put up 21.00 points on SNF and 16.88 on MNF (combining to be 41% of their total score), but Limeira Dead Rabbits still got the 107.54 to 92.58 victory. The late-match efforts were somewhat unexpected, considering their pregame projections forecasted 17.30 points on Sunday night and 0.60 on Monday. Limeira Dead Rabbits was led by Damien Harris (106 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). Harris scored two touchdowns and provided 25.30 points to the effort.

Amparo Bikers (4-3, 815.28 points) drops to seventh place, while Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-0, 883.54 points) remains in first place.

 J.D. McKissic probably deserved more touches for Amparo Bikers, as he put up a whopping 56 total yards on just eight touches.

 Since Harris was the top point-getter for Limeira Dead Rabbits, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 31.90 points, D.J. Moore paced the squad in Week 4, while Austin Ekeler (32.90 points) was tops in Week 5 and CeeDee Lamb (36.10 points) last week.

### Behind a Sizzling Showing from Alvin Kamara, Campinas Giants Rallies to Beat Sorocaba Steelers

Campinas Giants (3-4, 756.32 points) remains in ninth place, while Sorocaba Steelers (1-6, 694.40 points) is still looking up at everyone from the cellar.

 On Campinas Giants, the Baltimore Ravens DEF wasn't just the one defense to earn a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the entire league in the negatives.

Rio Claro Farmers (3-4, 878.74 points) remains in 10th place and Goncalves Miners (1-6, 759.14 points) stays in 13th place.

 Josh Jacobs ultimately deserved more touches for Rio Claro Farmers, as he put up a whopping 68 total yards on just nine touches.

 Since Evans was the top point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 29.02 points, Matt Ryan paced the squad in Week 4, while Davante Adams (37.60 points) was tops in Week 5 and Carson Wentz (17.02 points) last week.

 Derrick Henry had plenty of chances for Indaiatuba Blues, but he logged just 102 total yards on 31 touches.

 Indaiatuba Blues was on another level with their wideouts, as they started two of the league's top-10 overall WRs this week (including Kupp, who was best overall). It wasn't all bad news for London Knights, as they did field a squad of real-life winners. Every starter except Mark Andrews suited up on an NFL team that won in Week 7. While Derrick Henry led Indaiatuba Blues with 35.60 points in Week 6, Kupp paced the squad this week with 37.60.
