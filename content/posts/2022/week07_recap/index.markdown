Limeira Jetsons took a 6.10-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. Limeira Jetsons has been unstoppable in this matchup as of late, winning three straight against Paulinia Robots. With D'Andre Swift delivering zero points for Limeira Jetsons, the result might have been even worse.

### With Their Top Guns Doing the Heavy Lifting, Indaiatuba Pats Throat-Punches Sorocaba Wild Mules 

The three-headed monster of Daniel Jones, Aaron Jones, and Rhamondre Stevenson carried the team, as Indaiatuba Pats humiliated Sorocaba Wild Mules 151.78 to 85.88. That threesome teamed up to record 81.18 points, winning the battle against Mike Evans, David Njoku, and Dak Prescott (44.98 combined points), the top three on Sorocaba Wild Mules. A.

 Since Jones was the high scorer for Indaiatuba Pats, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the last six weeks. With 32.00 points, Aaron Jones paced the squad in Week 2, while A.J. Brown (19.50 points) was team-leader in Week 3 and Jared Goff (33.22 points) led the way in Week 4.

Barao Butchers took command of the matchup first with a 27.12 to 17.60 lead heading into Sunday. That advantage evaporated by the end of the early Sunday games and they trailed by 4.88.

Limeira Dead Rabbits was led by Ja'Marr Chase with 33.00 points (130 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and Mike Williams, who scored 21.60 (86 Rec Yds, 1 TD). The outcome might have been different had Limeira Dead Rabbits not had two starters score zero points (Romeo Doubs and J.K. Dobbins). Amparo Bikers (3-4, 761.32 points) remains in ninth place and Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-3, 753.70 points) stays in seventh place.

### Sorocaba Steelers Puts the Sting on Campinas Giants for 4th Consecutive Win 

Sorocaba Steelers got 25.40 points from JuJu Smith-Schuster (124 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 18.90 from Travis Etienne (114 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 1 TD) to shred Campinas Giants 110.88 to 74.66.

They got 112.20 points two weeks ago, 76.28 last week, and 74.66 points this week. To make matters worse, Campinas Giants had a starter score zero points (Michael Gallup). Campinas Giants (2-5, 698.18 points) drops to 11th place and Sorocaba Steelers (5-2, 743.68 points) remains in fifth place.

 Jeff Wilson ultimately deserved more touches for Campinas Giants, as he put up a whopping 54 total yards on just seven touches.

 Since Smith-Schuster was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 39.90 points, T.J. Hockenson paced the squad in Week 4, while Derrick Henry (27.20 points) was tops in Week 5 and Tyreek Hill (29.70 points) last week.

### With Their Top Guns Doing the Heavy Lifting, Goncalves Miners Tramples Rio Claro Farmers 

The trio of Joe Burrow, Josh Jacobs, and the Dallas Cowboys DEF carried the team, as Goncalves Miners humiliated Rio Claro Farmers 180.04 to 100.90. That threesome combined to score 97.74 points, topping the production from the top scorers from Rio Claro Farmers (Saquon Barkley, Alvin Kamara, and Jerry Jeudy), who totaled 51.60 points.

### London Knights Gets Comeback over Indaiatuba Blues to Grab 8th Place 

Down 3.14 on Sunday night, London Knights came back to defeat Indaiatuba Blues 101.26 to 90.40. London Knights took advantage of 18.30 points from Terry McLaurin (73 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 16.50 from D'Onta Foreman (118 Rsh Yds, 27 Rec Yds). This matchup included four lead changes, with the largest lead being 23.30 points after Thursday. After dropping their last five matchups, Indaiatuba Blues has fallen apart. London Knights (3-4) sits two games ahead of Indaiatuba Blues (1-6), but point totals show a different story, with Indaiatuba Blues up 810.90 to 595.68. Adding insult to injury, Indaiatuba Blues had a starter score zero points (Kirk Cousins).

 Jerick McKinnon probably deserved more touches for London Knights, as he put up a whopping 48 total yards on just four touches.

 London Knights got pretty lucky that Indaiatuba Blues's best WR had the week off, since Curtis Samuel only tallied 12.90 points. If Cooper Kupp (24.80 points per game this year) was in the lineup and hit his average, London Knights would've been beaten by 1.04 points. Since McLaurin led all scorers on the winning side, it means a different player has been the top scorer on London Knights in every match this year.

 London Knights faces Campinas Giants (2-5, 698.18) next week. Indaiatuba Blues plays Paulinia Robots (5-2, 874.76), who has averaged a league-leading 124.97 points this season.
