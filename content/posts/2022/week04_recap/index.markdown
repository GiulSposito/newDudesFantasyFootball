## Teams Performances

## League Highlights

Limeira Jetsons has started the season off on the right foot with a four-game winning streak.

Rio Claro Farmers has now started the season on a four-game winning streak.

Sorocaba Steelers has now beaten their weekly score projection in each matchup this season.

Teams have won 54.2% of the time this season when they throw no picks in a week.

Teams have won 75.0% of the time this season when starting the league's top-scoring WR of the week.

Unfortunately, Barao Butchers fell short of their projected score for the third straight week.

Teams that started a top-5 scoring QB only went 1-2 overall this week.

Limeira Jetsons probably wishes they had started Geno Smith. The 31.70 points he scored would have represented the fifth-highest individual score this week.

Paulinia Robots was favored to win by the biggest margin in the league this week (24.26 points) but ended up losing by 1.84 points.

First-round draft choices proved their worth this week by averaging 18.86 points, while players chosen in the second round averaged 12.79 and third-rounders 11.43.

The average projected score for Week 4 was 104.35 points.

## Matchups Recap

### Sorocaba Steelers Grinds Out Victory over Paulinia Robots, Pushes Them from 1st Place 

This week's two highest-scoring teams met in a shootout as Sorocaba Steelers snuck by Paulinia Robots 132.90 to 131.06. This is the four loss in recent years where Paulinia Robots has lost to Sorocaba Steelers despite a high score. The loss drops Paulinia Robots to 3-1 (3rd place) and breaks their three-game winning streak. The score from Sorocaba Steelers was a bit surprising given that they were only projected to score 91.72 points. Paulinia Robots scored 113.0% of their expected 115.98. T.J. Hockenson (179 Rec Yds, 2 TD) got the highest score of the week (39.90) and Tyreek Hill scored 25.90 points to lead Sorocaba Steelers. Dameon Pierce (131 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) put up 25.90 points to score 140.9% more than projected (10.75) for Paulinia Robots. The gap could have been wider, as Sorocaba Steelers had a starter who didn't score (Jameis Winston).

 In Week 5, Sorocaba Steelers takes on London Knights (2-2, 352.60), while Paulinia Robots matches up against Rio Claro Farmers (4-0, 476.40).

### Limeira Jetsons Pounds Sorocaba Wild Mules, Takes Top Spot in League 

A push in prime time on both Sunday Night Football and Monday Night Football wasn't nearly enough for Sorocaba Wild Mules. They scored 30.30 points on SNF and 22.30 on MNF (combining to be 60% of their total score), but Limeira Jetsons still easily got the 127.40 to 87.56 victory. Limeira Jetsons was led by Tee Higgins this week, who provided 25.40 points (124 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Jamaal Williams also helped out with 23.90 points by getting two touchdowns (108 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). Limeira Jetsons (4-0, 512.80 points) climbs into first place, while Sorocaba Wild Mules (0-4, 376.02 points) stays in last place.

 In addition to the fantasy victory, Limeira Jetsons was savvy enough to pick winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, the Detroit RB is the only one that played on a losing NFL team this week.

 Next week, Limeira Jetsons takes on Amparo Bikers (1-3, 460.42), while Sorocaba Wild Mules matches up against Goncalves Miners (3-1, 420.46).

### London Knights Pulls Off Comeback over Indaiatuba Riders, Rises to 8th Place 

London Knights got 28.70 points from Rashaad Penny (151 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) and 23.70 from Deebo Samuel (115 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to edge Indaiatuba Riders 101.74 to 98.66. London Knights came into the Monday night game facing a 13.86-point deficit, but scored 23.70 for the comeback victory. This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands three times, with the largest lead being 13.86 points after Sunday night. This close win was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Riders in their last meeting a season ago. With Dalton Schultz delivering zero points for London Knights, the result might have been even worse. London Knights (2-2, 352.60 points) climbs into eighth place and Indaiatuba Riders (1-3, 424.30 points) drops to 13th place.

 Next week, London Knights takes on Sorocaba Steelers (2-2, 439.62), while Indaiatuba Riders gets Indaiatuba Blues (1-3, 505.88).

### Goncalves Miners Picks Up Victory over Barao Butchers, Grabs 5th Place 

A primetime rally on Sunday Night Football (34.70 points, 36% of their total score) wasn't enough for Barao Butchers, as Goncalves Miners got the 120.98 to 95.70 victory. The late-match efforts were a bit unexpected, considering their original Sunday night projection was only 30.89 points. Goncalves Miners was led by Josh Jacobs (144 Rsh Yds, 31 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Jacobs scored two touchdowns and added 34.50 points to the cause. With Chase Claypool delivering zero points for Goncalves Miners, the margin could have been bigger. Goncalves Miners (3-1, 420.46 points) climbs into fifth place, while Barao Butchers (1-3, 351.72 points) drops to ninth place.

 Goncalves Miners takes on Sorocaba Wild Mules (0-4, 376.02) next week, while Barao Butchers goes up against Limeira Dead Rabbits (2-2, 435.80).
