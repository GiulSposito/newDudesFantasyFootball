Paulinia Robots continues their dominance in the series, improving to 3-1 against Amparo Bikers. A true difference-maker, Ja'Marr Chase (177 Rec Yds, 2 TD) put up 45.10 points this week, although it was a little less than his 55.40 points the last time these teams met. Paulinia Robots averages 165.68 points in the series, which is much higher than their season average. They played their best this week, scoring the highest point total in the league this season.

Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 2.18-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. With the win, Sorocaba Wild Mules clinches a spot in the playoffs.

This tight win was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Blues in their last meeting a season ago. Indaiatuba Riders (5-9, 1,405.60 points) climbs into 12th place and Indaiatuba Blues (fourth place, 8-6, 1,560.84 points) earns a playoff berth despite the loss.

 Tyler Allgeier really deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Riders, as he put up a whopping 63 total yards on just nine touches.

 Since Purdy was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 29.80 points, Tee Higgins paced the squad in Week 11, while Cooper Kupp (20.00 points) was tops in Week 12 and David Njoku (26.20 points) last week.

### Campinas Giants Comes Back to Edge Limeira Jetsons, Rises to 9th Place 

This week's second- and third-highest-scoring teams met in an epic battle as Campinas Giants came back from being down 7.16 on Monday night to sneak past Limeira Jetsons 147.86 to 146.46. This is the most a team has scored this season without getting a victory. Limeira Jetsons falls to 7th (7-7) in the standings.

Tyreek Hill (115 Rec Yds, 1 TD) put up 28.10 points and Isaac Guerendo (78 Rsh Yds, 50 Rec Yds, 2 TD) scored 26.80 points, exceeding their projections by 103.2% and 135.9%, respectively.

That pair topped their scoring projections by 527.9% and 112.7%, respectively. Although emerging victorious this time, Campinas Giants has been on the losing end of a similar high-scoring matchup once before, suffering a tough loss against Limeira Dead Rabbits in Week 1, 133.06 to 129.86.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field. On the winning side, De'Von Achane got 20 touches but only tallied 69 total yards, while Jahmyr Gibbs managed just 73 yards on 21 touches for Limeira Jetsons.

 Since Hill was the top point-getter for Campinas Giants, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 29.04 points, Joe Burrow paced the squad in Week 11, while De'Von Achane (20.60 points) was tops in Week 12 and Mike Evans (25.80 points) in Week 13.
