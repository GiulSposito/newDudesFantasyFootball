### Indaiatuba Riders Beats Amparo Bikers, Grabs 8th Place 

Indaiatuba Riders (4-5, 990.32 points) got the 17th-highest player score on the season from Davante Adams (146 Rec Yds, 2 TD) to beat Amparo Bikers (3-6, 986.78 points) 123.10 to 100.36 in a seesaw battle. Indaiatuba Riders took command of the matchup first with a 24.00 to 8.00 lead heading into Sunday. That advantage disappeared by the end of the early Sunday games and they trailed by 2.56. However, following the late Sunday games, Indaiatuba Riders regained the lead for good with the help of 11.00 points from Leonard Fournette.

 There was one player on Amparo Bikers who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Even though Amon-Ra St. Brown saw a total of nine targets, he reeled in just four catches.

 Since Adams was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 22.10 points, Leonard Fournette paced the squad in Week 6, while Trevor Lawrence (18.70 points) was tops in Week 7 and Tony Pollard (33.70 points) in Week 8.

Indaiatuba Pats (7-2, 1,130.88 points) climbs into first place, while Rio Claro Farmers (6-3, 1,046.30 points) stays in fifth place.

 There was one player on Indaiatuba Pats who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Despite being targeted seven times, Rhamondre Stevenson could manage just three catches.

 Since Mixon was the high scorer for Indaiatuba Pats, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the last six weeks. With 33.22 points, Jared Goff paced the squad in Week 4, while Gabe Davis (32.10 points) was team-leader in Week 5 and Rhamondre Stevenson (25.10 points) led the way in Week 6.

### London Knights Wins Comeback Nailbiter over Barao Butchers, Streak Now at Three 

London Knights got 14.00 points from Nick Folk and 13.64 from Aaron Rodgers (291 Pas Yds, 40 Rsh Yds, 1 TD/3 Int), edging Barao Butchers 72.94 to 70.80.

London Knights (5-4, 799.00 points) climbs into seventh place and Barao Butchers (2-7, 822.42 points) drops to 13th place.

 Since Folk was the top point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 16.00 points, Deebo Samuel paced the squad in Week 6, while Terry McLaurin (18.30 points) was tops in Week 7 and D'Onta Foreman (31.80 points) last week.

### Indaiatuba Blues Brings Down Campinas Giants to Move into 11th Place 

Cooper Kupp racked up 26.80 points and Josh Allen added another 24.80 points with two touchdowns as Indaiatuba Blues beat Campinas Giants 128.80 to 91.10. Indaiatuba Blues took a 24.20-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup. After dropping their last four matchups, Campinas Giants can't find any answers.

On top of the loss, Campinas Giants had a starter score zero points (Tyler Higbee).

On the losing side, Deon Jackson and David Montgomery got 28 total touches but only tallied 80 all-purpose yards between them. For Indaiatuba Blues, AJ Dillon managed just 44 yards on 13 touches.

 Since Kupp was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Blues, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 26.36 points, Josh Allen paced the squad in Week 6, while Eno Benjamin (23.30 points) was tops in Week 7 and Nick Chubb (25.40 points) in Week 8.
