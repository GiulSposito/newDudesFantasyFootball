### Indaiatuba Blues Comes from Behind to Squeak By Sorocaba Steelers, Claims 4th Place 

Indaiatuba Blues had an excellent primetime performance with 27.10 points on Sunday Night Football and 21.88 on Monday (a combined 46% of their total score) to slip by Sorocaba Steelers 107.58 to 105.36.

Skattebo scored three touchdowns and contributed 31.00 points in the narrow victory. With the San Francisco 49ers DEF delivering zero points for Indaiatuba Blues, the margin could have been larger. The 2.22-point win represented the third-tightest in the league this year, as well.

 Since Skattebo was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Blues, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 29.12 points, Caleb Williams paced the squad in Week 3, while Justin Jefferson (22.60 points) was tops in Week 4 and Sam Darnold (27.64 points) last week.

 Next week, Indaiatuba Blues will meet London Knights (3-3, 606.86). Sorocaba Steelers takes on Campinas Giants (6-0, 713.92), who is averaging a strong 118.99 points per game.
