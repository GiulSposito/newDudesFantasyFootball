### Barao Butchers Beats Indaiatuba Pats for 4th in a Row 

A last-ditch rally on Monday Night Football (40.20 points, 46% of their total score) wasn't enough for Indaiatuba Pats, in spite of the efforts of Keenan Allen (85 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and CeeDee Lamb (117 Rec Yds), as Barao Butchers earned the 99.20 to 87.14 victory. The late-match efforts were a little unexpected, considering their original Monday projection was only 31.56 points. Barao Butchers was led by Raheem Mostert (115 Rsh Yds, 2 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). Mostert scored three touchdowns and provided 34.20 points to the cause. Barao Butchers (5-1, 661.12 points) climbs into second place, while Indaiatuba Pats (3-3, 669.00 points) drops to ninth place.

 Austin Ekeler had plenty of chances for Barao Butchers, but he logged just 62 total yards on 18 touches. One slot where Indaiatuba Pats is really kicking themselves is wide receiver. Amon-Ra St. Brown could have started in place of Puka Nacua, and that point difference would've been enough to win.

 While the Seahawks Defense led Barao Butchers in Week 4 (with 30.00 points) and Brock Purdy weeks (26.08 points), Mostert has now been the team's leading point-getter in three of the last five matches.

 Barao Butchers plays Indaiatuba Riders (3-3, 703.32) in Week 7, while Indaiatuba Pats faces Sorocaba Wild Mules (3-3, 689.82).
