## Matchups Recap

### Barao Butchers Gets Late Win Against Paulinia Robots, Takes Championship 

Barao Butchers was clutch with 57.30 points on Monday Night Football (44% of their total score) to steal the win from Paulinia Robots 130.70 to 111.62. The late heroics were a bit unexpected, since they were originally projected to put up 43.23 points on Monday night. Barao Butchers was led by Najee Harris (188 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). The Pittsburgh RB rushed for 188 yards and contributed 29.60 points to the effort.

 A spot where Paulinia Robots really made a regrettable decision is wide receiver. Braxton Berrios could have started in place of A.J. Brown, and that point difference would've changed the outcome.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Barao Butchers was savvy enough to select winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Donovan Peoples-Jones was the only one that suited up on a losing NFL team this past week.

 Despite the loss, Paulinia Robots had a few players performing their best in the playoffs, most notably Rashaad Penny and the Philadelphia Eagles DEF. During the postseason, that combo has averaged 19.47 and 11.00 points, respectively, topping their season-long marks by 143% and 59%. Conversely, the losers had several players who struggled in the playoff spotlight, including D'Andre Swift and Tyler Lockett.

 Barao Butchers wrapped up the regular season in fourth place with a record of 8-6. In terms of scoring average, they ranked slightly better (third with 116.98). They played in a pair of previous postseason games this year on their trail to the title. In their last game, Barao Butchers beat Indaiatuba Riders, 114.06 to 101.12. The week before, they took down Sorocaba Wild Mules, 96.34 to 91.64. Paulinia Robots ended the regular season in sixth place with a record of 7-7. Better than their record indicated, they ranked first in the league in points per game with 121.12. They played in a pair of previous postseason games this year. In their last game, Paulinia Robots leveled Limeira Dead Rabbits, 124.60 to 83.36. The week before, they annihilated Limeira Jetsons, 138.48 to 88.32. They distributed their fair share of beatdowns this year, as they racked up four blowout victories on the season.

### Limeira Jetsons Brings Down Sorocaba Wild Mules, Goes to 2-0 Against Them 

Limeira Jetsons defeated Sorocaba Wild Mules 110.12 to 103.88 for their second win in as many head-to-head matchups. Their overall record goes to 10-6, while Sorocaba Wild Mules drops to 8-8. Limeira Jetsons improves their all-time playoff record against Sorocaba Wild Mules to 2-1. The teams' last postseason matchup also resulted in a Limeira Jetsons win in the consolation semifinals in 2019. Noah Fant (92 Rec Yds, 1 TD) was the determining factor this week, picking up 21.20 points. Coming off his outstanding performance, Fant elevated into the top 10 for tight ends, averaging 10.43 points per game. With Zane Gonzalez delivering zero points for Limeira Jetsons, the margin could have been bigger.

 Sorocaba Wild Mules had one glaring starter that missed out on opportunities. Despite being targeted 13 times, DeVante Parker could only manage four catches.

 For the winners, two players have been heating up in the postseason : Fant and the Los Angeles Rams DEF. During the playoffs, that duo has exceeded their season scoring averages by 65% and 63%, respectively. Conversely, Limeira Jetsons has a few players trending the opposite way. Amari Cooper and Joe Mixon have both substantially underperformed their year-to-date averages during the postseason.
