### Indaiatuba Riders Picks Up Victory over Goncalves Miners for 3rd in a Row 

Goncalves Miners found it difficult to score this week and lost to Indaiatuba Riders 102.52 to 56.60.

Indaiatuba Riders (7-5, 1,335.44 points) climbs into fifth place and Goncalves Miners (4-8, 1,075.86 points) stays in 11th place.

 Charbonnet had plenty of opportunities for Goncalves Miners, but could only manage 58 total yards on 18 touches.

 Since Pollard was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 15.80 points, Patrick Mahomes paced the squad in Week 9, while George Kittle (20.60 points) was tops in Week 10 and Brandon Aiyuk (26.60 points) last week.

Amparo Bikers took a 5.08-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Indaiatuba Blues has now lost three straight matchups. The gap could have been wider as Amparo Bikers had a starter score zero points (the Detroit Lions DEF). Amparo Bikers (5-7, 1,205.28 points) remains in 10th place and Indaiatuba Blues (3-9, 1,137.56 points) stays in 13th place.

 Javonte Williams had plenty of chances for Amparo Bikers, but he logged just 71 total yards on 21 touches.

### Sorocaba Steelers Gets Late Win Against Limeira Jetsons Who Drops 3rd in a Row 

Sorocaba Steelers got the second-highest score this week and erased a 2.40-point deficit on Sunday night to beat Limeira Jetsons 137.76 to 124.86. Limeira Jetsons has now dropped three straight.

Limeira Jetsons (7-5, 1,338.22 points) drops to sixth place and Sorocaba Steelers (3-9, 1,274.48 points) remains mired in the cellar.

 Digging deeper into the match, Limeira Jetsons can point the finger at their ill-fated foursome, Jahmyr Gibbs, the Browns Defense, Diontae Johnson, and Travis Etienne. That group was projected to combine for 51.08 points, but wound up with 35.90, and that difference was all Sorocaba Steelers needed to capitalize.

 While Kyler Murray led Sorocaba Steelers in Week 10 (with 17.26 points) and Davante Adams last week (21.20 points), Stroud has now been the team's high point-getter twice in the past four weeks.

 Sorocaba Steelers plays Goncalves Miners (4-8, 1,075.86) in Week 13, while Limeira Jetsons matches up with London Knights (8-4, 1,362.08).

### London Knights Wins Comeback Nailbiter over Rio Claro Farmers, Moves Up to 4th Place 

London Knights got the third-highest player score of the week from Jalen Hurts with 34.50 points (200 Pas Yds, 65 Rsh Yds, 3 Pas TD/1 Int, 2 Rsh TD) and erased a 24.96-point deficit on Monday night, slipping by Rio Claro Farmers 112.90 to 111.46. This was one of the tightest outcomes to date, with the 1.44-point margin being the third-smallest recorded in the league this season. Rio Claro Farmers was led by Christian McCaffrey with 30.90 points (114 Rsh Yds, 25 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and the Dallas Cowboys DEF, who scored 16.00 (10 PA, 1 TD, 4 Sack, 1 Int). The margin could have been larger as London Knights had a starter score zero points (Mark Andrews). London Knights (8-4, 1,362.08 points) climbs into fourth place and Rio Claro Farmers (7-5, 1,370.06 points) drops to seventh place.

 On London Knights, the Washington Commanders DEF wasn't just the one defense to earn a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the entire league in the red.

 While Ja'Marr Chase led London Knights in Week 10 (with 23.40 points) and DJ Moore weeks (22.60 points), Hurts has now been the team's top point-getter in four of the last six matches.

 In Week 13, London Knights squares off against Limeira Jetsons (7-5, 1,338.22), while Rio Claro Farmers gets Indaiatuba Blues (3-9, 1,137.56).

### Indaiatuba Pats Rallies to Beat Limeira Dead Rabbits for 4th Straight Win 

One week after a blowout victory, Indaiatuba Pats (8-4, 1,476.60 points) got a tough win against Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-9, 1,160.46 points) 112.40 to 94.76.

However, Indaiatuba Pats came out of the Ravens/Chargers Sunday night game ahead by 13.14.

 Sanders had plenty of opportunities for Limeira Dead Rabbits, but could only manage 28 total yards on 15 touches. One position where Limeira Dead Rabbits really made a painful call is WR. Tyreek Hill could have started in place of Jerry Jeudy, and that point difference would've been enough to win.
