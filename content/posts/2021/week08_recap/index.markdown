## Matchups Recap

### Indaiatuba Blues Gets Victory over Paulinia Robots for 3rd Straight Win 

In an epic battle between this week's two highest-scoring teams, Indaiatuba Blues defeated Paulinia Robots 139.60 to 127.96. This is the four loss in recent years where Paulinia Robots has lost despite a high score. The loss drops Paulinia Robots to 4-4 (7th place) and extends their losing streak to four. Indaiatuba Blues (5-3) is in fourth place and has the highest points per game average at 130.18. However, the score from Indaiatuba Blues was tough to predict given that they were only projected to score 103.27 points. Paulinia Robots scored 110.2% of their expected 116.11. Michael Carter (77 Rsh Yds, 95 Rec Yds, 1 TD) logged the highest score of the week (32.20) and A.J. Brown scored 31.50 points to lead Indaiatuba Blues. Tyreek Hill (94 Rec Yds, 1 TD) put up 27.40 points for Paulinia Robots.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field. On the winning side, Derrick Henry got 28 touches but only tallied 68 total yards, while D'Andre Swift managed just 51 yards on 17 touches for Paulinia Robots.

 There were some positive notes for Paulinia Robots, as they did start two of the league's top-10 overall WRs this week. While Cooper Kupp led Indaiatuba Blues last week with 37.60 points, Carter paved the way this week with 32.20.

 Next week, Indaiatuba Blues squares off against Campinas Giants (4-4, 866.30), while Paulinia Robots battles Goncalves Miners (1-7, 841.50).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Pounds Indaiatuba Riders, Takes Revenge 

Sorocaba Wild Mules took advantage of 28.00 points from Chris Godwin (140 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 24.00 from Aaron Jones (59 Rsh Yds, 51 Rec Yds, 1 TD), stomping Indaiatuba Riders 125.32 to 50.70. Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 32.60-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Sorocaba Wild Mules has been dominating this matchup as of late, winning three straight against Indaiatuba Riders. On top of the loss, Indaiatuba Riders had three starters put up zeroes. Indaiatuba Riders (5-3, 921.92 points) drops to third place and Sorocaba Wild Mules (4-4, 968.90 points) remains in 11th place.

 On Sorocaba Wild Mules, the Chicago Bears DEF wasn't just the one DEF to earn a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the entire league to do so.

 Since Godwin was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Wild Mules, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 42.82 points, Justin Herbert paced the squad in Week 5, while Aaron Jones (21.00 points) was tops in Week 6 and Joe Burrow (26.64 points) in Week 7.

### Amparo Bikers Drops the Hammer on Indaiatuba Pats, Moves to 5th Place 

Amparo Bikers took advantage of 29.46 points from Josh Allen (249 Pas Yds, 55 Rsh Yds, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) and 23.10 from Deebo Samuel (171 Rec Yds), clobbering Indaiatuba Pats 114.66 to 73.40. The beating was the second blowout of the year for Amparo Bikers. This is the third straight week Indaiatuba Pats has scored less than their previous week's point total. They got 122.58 points two weeks ago, 102.44 last week, and 73.40 points this week. The result might have been even worse as Amparo Bikers had a starter score zero points (Mo Alie-Cox). Amparo Bikers (5-3, 929.94 points) climbs into fifth place and Indaiatuba Pats (4-4, 900.74 points) stays in sixth place.

 James Robinson ultimately deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Pats, as he put up a whopping 39 total yards on just five touches.

 While Deebo Samuel led Amparo Bikers in Weeks 4 and 7, Allen has now been the team's leading scorer in four of the last six matches. Finally, even though he failed to catch five of the targets that came his way, the fact that Jakobi Meyers got nine looks means that his targets have now increased in three straight games.

 Next week, Amparo Bikers takes on Indaiatuba Riders (5-3, 921.92), while Indaiatuba Pats matches up with Rio Claro Farmers (4-4, 1,004.92).

### Rio Claro Farmers Smokes Limeira Dead Rabbits, Rises to 8th Place 

Rio Claro Farmers picked up 22.30 points from DK Metcalf (43 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and 19.74 from Tyler Boyd (69 Rec Yds, 1 TD), stomping Limeira Dead Rabbits 126.18 to 87.42. Rio Claro Farmers took a 4.66-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. Limeira Dead Rabbits is not on the same level as Rio Claro Farmers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Eli Mitchell (acquired via free agency in Week 2) made a big impact, posting 19.70 points. To make matters worse, Limeira Dead Rabbits received no points from Rob Gronkowski. Rio Claro Farmers (4-4, 1,004.92 points) climbs into eighth place and Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-1, 970.96 points) stays in first place.

 Harris had plenty of opportunities for Limeira Dead Rabbits, but could only manage 80 total yards on 23 touches.

 Since Metcalf was the leading point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 29.02 points, Matt Ryan paced the squad in Week 4, while Davante Adams put up 37.60 points to lead the way in Week 5. Carson Wentz (17.02 points) was tops in Week 6 and Mike Evans (31.60 points) led last week.

### Campinas Giants Steals One from London Knights 

Campinas Giants (4-4, 866.30 points) beat London Knights (2-6, 973.18 points) 109.98 to 96.50 in a matchup with three lead changes. Their top player was Michael Pittman (86 Rec Yds, 2 TD), who had the 46th-highest player score for the season. Campinas Giants took command of the matchup first with a 10.00 to 6.00 lead heading into Sunday. That advantage evaporated by the end of the early Sunday games and they trailed by 26.20. However, Campinas Giants recovered for the win on Monday night, with Daniel Jones scoring 16.08 points during the Giants/Chiefs game.

 There were a few players in this matchup that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field. On the winning side, Alvin Kamara and Khalil Herbert got 47 total touches but only tallied 148 all-purpose yards between them. For London Knights, Kenneth Gainwell managed just 27 yards on 13 touches. A spot where London Knights really made a regrettable choice is RB. Darrell Henderson could have started in place of Kenneth Gainwell, and that point difference would have been enough to secure the victory.

 Since Pittman was the top point-getter for Campinas Giants, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 41.88 points, Lamar Jackson paced the squad in Week 5, while Mike Gesicki (19.50 points) was tops in Week 6 and Alvin Kamara (33.90 points) last week. Also, with 25 touches this week for Khalil Herbert, it means that his touches have now increased in five consecutive games.

 Next week, Campinas Giants battles Indaiatuba Blues (5-3, 1,041.44), who puts up a league-leading 130.18 points per game. London Knights gets Barao Butchers (4-4, 904.82).

### Limeira Jetsons Gets Victory over Goncalves Miners for 3rd Straight Win 

A primetime rally on Sunday Night Football (34.96 points, 42% of their total score) wasn't enough for Goncalves Miners, as Limeira Jetsons got the 104.96 to 82.36 victory. Limeira Jetsons was led by Amari Cooper this week, who provided 26.20 points (122 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Joe Mixon also pitched in with 25.10 points on two touchdowns (33 Rsh Yds, 58 Rec Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). To make matters worse, Goncalves Miners got zero points from Justin Tucker. Limeira Jetsons (6-2, 885.28 points) climbs into second place, while Goncalves Miners (1-7, 841.50 points) stays in 13th place.

 Jeremy McNichols probably deserved more touches for Limeira Jetsons, as he put up a whopping 33 total yards on just three touches.

 Since Cooper was the top point-getter for Limeira Jetsons, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 36.50 points, Mike Williams paced the squad in Week 5, while Joe Mixon (26.30 points) was tops in Week 6 and Aaron Rodgers (24.66 points) last week.

 In Week 9, Limeira Jetsons goes up against first-place Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-1, 970.96). Goncalves Miners will take on Paulinia Robots (4-4, 1,020.36), who is averaging a strong 127.55 points per game.
