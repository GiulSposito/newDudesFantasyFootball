## League Highlights

Sorocaba Wild Mules and Campinas Giants each got wins this week despite not starting a top-30 scoring WR.

As one might expect, teams have won 66.7% of the time this season when they throw no interceptions in a week.

Teams that were projected to win went undefeated this week (7-0 overall).

First-round draft picks averaged 13.93 points this week, but actually underperformed when compared to their second-round counterparts (who averaged 17.60).

Indaiatuba Riders beat their projections by a higher percentage than anyone else in the league this week. They put up 92.06 points when they were only projected 70.86.

Barao Butchers scored 132.64 points, the highest mark in the league this week.

### Campinas Giants Tops Rio Claro Farmers 

Campinas Giants picked up the second-highest player points this week from De'Von Achane with 29.50 points (96 Rsh Yds, 69 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD) and took down Rio Claro Farmers 88.02 to 73.00. Campinas Giants took a 30.60-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. This win comes as revenge for Campinas Giants following a tough postseason defeat last year to Rio Claro Farmers. With the Dolphins Defense delivering zero points for Campinas Giants, the gap could have been wider. Campinas Giants (1-1, 217.88 points) shifts into fourth place and Rio Claro Farmers (1-1, 198.42 points) goes to 12th place.

 For Campinas Giants, Cade Otton was one of two starters league-wide to post a negative score (and the only tight end in negative territory ). Jerome Ford really deserved more touches for Campinas Giants, as he put up an efficient 64 all-purpose yards on just eight total touches.

 In Week 3, Campinas Giants plays Sorocaba Wild Mules (1-1, 214.22), while Rio Claro Farmers gets Indaiatuba Pats (0-2, 189.34).

### With Their Top Guns Doing the Heavy Lifting, Indaiatuba Blues Beats London Knights 

The trio of James Cook, Davante Adams, and Derrick Henry led the way, as Indaiatuba Blues beat London Knights 112.76 to 82.26. That threesome combined to score 71.10 points, topping the production from the top scorers from London Knights (CeeDee Lamb, David Montgomery, and Evan McPherson), who totaled 51.00 points. Cook scored three touchdowns, registering 28.50 points (78 Rsh Yds, 2 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). Adams also delivered 26.00 points (110 Rec Yds, 1 TD), while Henry helped out with 16.60 points (84 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). On top of the loss, London Knights had a starter score zero points (Jake Ferguson). Indaiatuba Blues (1-1, 213.64 points) shifts into eighth place, while London Knights (1-1, 206.24 points) goes to ninth place.

 Chase Brown probably deserved more touches for London Knights, as he put up a whopping 31 total yards on just four touches.

### Barao Butchers Gets Victory Against Limeira Jetsons 

Barao Butchers logged the highest score of the week and got past Limeira Jetsons 132.64 to 125.94. Limeira Jetsons is not on the same level as Barao Butchers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Justin Jefferson led Limeira Jetsons with 23.30 points (133 Rec Yds, 1 TD) while DeVonta Smith brought in 20.60 (76 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Limeira Jetsons needs results from fourth-round draft pick Amari Cooper, who has scored 3.60 points and 4.10 points the past two weeks. Barao Butchers (1-1, 235.08 points) moves into seventh place and Limeira Jetsons (1-1, 242.90 points) winds up in sixth place.

 There was one starter on Limeira Jetsons who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Despite being targeted eight times, Amari Cooper could manage just three catches. One slot where Limeira Jetsons is wishing they could get a do-over is WR. Darnell Mooney could have started in place of Cooper, and that point difference would've altered the outcome.

 Barao Butchers gets Amparo Bikers (2-0, 215.98) in Week 3, while Limeira Jetsons matches up with Sorocaba Steelers (1-1, 233.86).

### Holambra Dutch Gets Victory over Indaiatuba Pats 

Each team had big performances in prime time, eventually resulting in a 120.78 to 96.42 Holambra Dutch victory. Holambra Dutch had a big Monday night with 46.00 points (38% of their total score) while Indaiatuba Pats earned 19.50 points Sunday night and 23.82 on MNF (a combined 45% of their score). Holambra Dutch was led by DK Metcalf, who added 28.90 points to the cause (129 Rec Yds, 1 TD). To make matters worse, Indaiatuba Pats had a starter score zero points (Keenan Allen). Holambra Dutch (1-1, 221.38 points) moves into 10th place, while Indaiatuba Pats (0-2, 189.34 points) winds up in 13th place.

 On Indaiatuba Pats, the Dallas Cowboys DEF represented one of two total league starters to tally a negative score (and the only DEF to do so ). Ty Chandler probably deserved more touches for Holambra Dutch, as he put up an efficient 82 all-purpose yards on just 10 total touches.
