### Amparo Bikers Snatches Win from Campinas Giants, Notches 6th in a Row 

Amparo Bikers (8-6, 1,629.66 points) beat Campinas Giants (8-6, 1,468.88 points) 105.78 to 92.76. They were led by Brandon Aubrey with 22.00 points off of five field goals as well as Travis Etienne (74 Rsh Yds, 2 TD), who had 21.20. Amparo Bikers scored first and went into Sunday leading 36.70 to 0.00. That advantage evaporated by the end of the early Sunday games and they trailed by 2.08. However, thanks to 16.10 points from Nico Collins during the Texans/Chiefs game, Sunday night ended with Amparo Bikers on top. With the win, Amparo Bikers assures themselves a spot in the playoffs.

### Sorocaba Steelers Rips Apart Holambra Dutch 

The combo of Harold Fannin Jr. and Christian Watson led the charge, as Sorocaba Steelers tore apart Holambra Dutch 138.46 to 56.14. That tandem combined to tally 50.30 points, topping the production from RJ Harvey and Dak Prescott (40.44 combined points), the top two on Holambra Dutch. Watson scored two touchdowns, accounting for 24.90 points (89 Rec Yds, 2 TD). For the winners, Jr. also helped out with 25.40 points (114 Rec Yds, 1 TD). This beatdown was revenge for a loss to Holambra Dutch in their last meeting a season ago. To make matters worse, Holambra Dutch had a starter score zero points (Tyrone Tracy Jr.). Sorocaba Steelers (5-9, 1,390.48 points) remains in 12th place and Holambra Dutch (2-12, 1,094.70 points) stays in 15th place.

 Since Fannin was the leading scorer for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has now led the team in each of the past seven matches.

 Sorocaba Steelers gets Indaiatuba Riders (4-10, 1,264.08) in Week 15, while Holambra Dutch faces Indaiatuba Blues (7-7, 1,398.60).

### Behind a Sizzling Showing from Michael Wilson, Indaiatuba Blues Beats Rio Claro Farmers 

The contribution from Michael Wilson proved decisive, as Indaiatuba Blues defeated Rio Claro Farmers 101.96 to 86.30. The Arizona WR heated up for 37.20 points to top projections by 25.75, carrying Indaiatuba Blues to a 15.66-point victory. He recorded two touchdowns as part of his huge game (142 Rec Yds, 2 TD). He also recorded the second-highest point total in the league this week. The outcome could have been worse as Indaiatuba Blues had a starter score zero points (Michael Mayer). Indaiatuba Blues (7-7, 1,398.60 points) climbs into 10th place. Rio Claro Farmers, despite the loss, clinches a playoff spot this week (fourth place, 8-6, 1,485.50 points).

 Woody Marks and Breece Hall had plenty of chances for Indaiatuba Blues, but they logged just 119 total yards on 42 combined touches between them.

 While Breece Hall led Indaiatuba Blues matches (with 15.60 points), Wilson has now been the team's leading scorer in two of the past three weeks.

 As the regular season comes to a close, Rio Claro Farmers can now set their sights on a playoff run.

### Limeira Jetsons Outlasts London Knights, Drops Them into 11th Place 

Limeira Jetsons got 35.70 points from Puka Nacua (167 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and 19.36 from Trevor Lawrence (244 Pas Yds, 2 TD) to nip London Knights 98.26 to 97.96. With the win, Limeira Jetsons secures a playoff spot. This close win was revenge for a loss to London Knights in their last meeting a season ago. Kenneth Gainwell (acquired via free agency in Week 1) made a big impact, posting 16.20 points. The result might have been even worse as Limeira Jetsons won despite two starters scoring zero points. Limeira Jetsons (8-6, 1,457.76 points) falls to eighth place and London Knights (6-8, 1,426.52 points) drops to 11th place.

 London Knights had one important starter that missed out on some chances. Despite being targeted nine times, Emeka Egbuka could only manage two catches.

 Since Nacua was the leading point-getter for Limeira Jetsons, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 22.40 points, Kyren Williams paced the squad in Week 10, while Tetairoa McMillan put up 33.00 points to lead the way in Week 11. Kenneth Gainwell (18.20 points) was tops in Week 12 and Trevor Lawrence (21.66 points) led in Week 13.

 Limeira Jetsons is playoff-bound next week.

### BroncosLoucura Tops Barao Butchers, Deepens Losing Streak Frustration 

Tyler Shough scored two touchdowns (21.26 points) and Saquon Barkley added 18.20 points as BroncosLoucura beat Barao Butchers 111.26 to 94.68. BroncosLoucura took a 36.26-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup. After losing their sixth straight, Barao Butchers is on the verge of a forgettable season. With Matthew Golden delivering zero points for BroncosLoucura, the margin could have been bigger. BroncosLoucura (7-7, 1,563.80 points) remains in ninth place and Barao Butchers (1-13, 1,201.84 points) is still looking up at everyone from last place.

 Zach Charbonnet really deserved more touches for BroncosLoucura, as he put up a whopping 66 total yards on just nine touches.

 While the Seahawks Defense led BroncosLoucura in Week 13 with 30.00 points, Shough paved the way this week with 21.26.

 BroncosLoucura squares off against Barao Butchers (1-13, 1,201.84) next week, while Barao Butchers gets BroncosLoucura (7-7, 1,563.80).
