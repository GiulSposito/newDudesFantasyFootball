### Indaiatuba Riders Rallies Against Indaiatuba Pats, Makes It Five in a Row 

Indaiatuba Riders beat Indaiatuba Pats 130.34 to 123.52 for their second win in as many head-to-head matchups. The two teams now have the same overall record, sitting at 9-5. Indaiatuba Pats has been a tough matchup for Indaiatuba Riders, whose a 6.70-point average margin of victory against Indaiatuba Pats is way less than their season-average margin of victory. Ezekiel Elliott (68 Rsh Yds, 72 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD) was the difference this week, picking up 27.00 points for Indaiatuba Riders. That's a little less than Brandon Aiyuk, who earned the top score with 32.90 points the last time these teams met.

 There was one player on Indaiatuba Pats who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Despite being targeted nine times, Amon-Ra St. Brown could manage just three catches. A position where Indaiatuba Pats made a blunder is quarterback. Matthew Stafford could have started in place of Joshua Dobbs, and that point difference would've been enough to win.

 While Tony Pollard led Indaiatuba Riders with 17.30 points last week, Elliott paced the squad this week with 27.00. Additionally, with 27 touches this week for Rachaad White, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Both Indaiatuba Riders and Indaiatuba Pats made the playoffs, which begin next week.

### Barao Butchers Pulverizes Amparo Bikers and Stays Undefeated in the Series 

Barao Butchers clinches a spot in the playoffs after taking down Amparo Bikers again, this time by a final score of 168.12 to 115.14. Their record improves to 8-6, while Amparo Bikers falls to 6-8. Deebo Samuel scored two touchdowns and led the effort this week, putting up 34.00 points. Samuel has turned out to be an excellent second-round pick for Barao Butchers, averaging 17.18 points per game.

 Amparo Bikers had one significant player that failed to capitalize on opportunites. Despite being targeted 13 times, Calvin Ridley could only manage four catches.

 Samuel has now led Barao Butchers in scoring in back-to-back weeks. Also, with 28 touches this week for Kyren Williams, it means that his touches have now increased in four consecutive games.

 As the regular season comes to a close, Barao Butchers can now set their sights on a playoff run.

### Sorocaba Steelers Wins Against Limeira Dead Rabbits for 3rd Straight Win

 Based on their production, Miles Sanders and Latavius Murray probably deserved to get the ball more, as they logged an impressive 104 total yards between them on just 14 combined touches for Limeira Dead Rabbits.

 Since Hopkins was the leading point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 17.26 points, Kyler Murray paced the squad in Week 10, while Davante Adams put up 21.20 points to lead the way in Week 11. C.J. Stroud (30.86 points) was tops in Week 12 and DeVonta Smith (24.60 points) led last week.

Rio Claro Farmers took one from Campinas Giants 104.70 to 102.64 for their second win in as many head-to-head matchups. The two teams now have the same overall record, sitting at 9-5.

With Noah Brown delivering zero points for Rio Claro Farmers, the result might have been even worse.

 There was one starter on Rio Claro Farmers that missed out on opportunities. Despite being targeted 11 times, Chris Godwin could manage just five catches.

 Since Browning was the top point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks.
