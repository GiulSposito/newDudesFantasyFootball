### Behind a Sizzling Showing from CeeDee Lamb, London Knights Beats Sorocaba Wild Mules

 Sorocaba Wild Mules had one glaring starter that missed out on some chances. Even though Kyle Pitts saw a total of eight targets, he only reeled in two catches.

 Since Lamb was the leading point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 16.00 points, Deebo Samuel paced the squad in Week 6, while Terry McLaurin put up 18.30 points to lead the way in Week 7. D'Onta Foreman (31.80 points) was tops in Week 8 and Nick Folk (14.00 points) led last week.
