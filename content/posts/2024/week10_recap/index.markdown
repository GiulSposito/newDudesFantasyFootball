### Powered by Their Big Three, Paulinia Robots Smokes Amparo Bikers 

With the three-headed monster of Ja'Marr Chase, Lamar Jackson, and Rachaad White carrying the team, Paulinia Robots overpowered Amparo Bikers 164.50 to 101.40.

### Behind Three Big Performances, Sorocaba Wild Mules Overwhelms Indaiatuba Blues 

The triumvirate of Bijan Robinson, Kyler Murray, and the Buffalo Bills DEF led the way, as Sorocaba Wild Mules overpowered Indaiatuba Blues 143.34 to 86.90. That threesome combined to record 77.14 points, significantly outperforming the top scorers from Indaiatuba Blues (Josh Allen, James Cook, and Derrick Henry), who totaled 47.80 points.

### Indaiatuba Riders Beats Holambra Dutch, Still Undefeated All-Time Versus Them 

The duo of Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey led the way, as Indaiatuba Riders picked up a win against Holambra Dutch 102.12 to 78.00. That tandem teamed up to register 40.52 points, clearly outpacing Drake London and T.J. Hockenson (32.90 combined points), the top two on Holambra Dutch. Purdy passed for 353 yards, adding 23.82 points (353 Pas Yds, 2 TD). McCaffrey also chipped in 16.70 points (39 Rsh Yds, 68 Rec Yds) for the winners. Holambra Dutch just doesn't have what it takes to beat Indaiatuba Riders, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Dallas Goedert (acquired via free agency in Week 9) made a big impact, posting 10.50 points. The outcome could have been worse as Indaiatuba Riders had a starter score zero points (Tee Higgins). Holambra Dutch (5-5, 1,117.88 points) drops to ninth place and Indaiatuba Riders (3-7, 953.42 points) remains mired in the cellar.

He passed for four touchdowns as part of his signature performance (428 Pas Yds, 4 TD). He also recorded the second-highest point total in the league this week. With 134.82 points, Campinas Giants had their top total of the season. Sorocaba Steelers (5-5, 1,161.92 points) steps into sixth place, while Campinas Giants (4-6, 1,049.18 points) remains in 12th place.

 There were a couple of players on both teams that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field.

### Rio Claro Farmers Grinds Out Win over Barao Butchers to Claim League's Top Spot 

After edging Barao Butchers (13th place, 3-7, 1,066.36 points) 109.54 to 108.94, Rio Claro Farmers (7-3, 1,136.22 points) takes ownership of the top spot in the league.

Barao Butchers still cannot beat Rio Claro Farmers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series.

### London Knights Tops Limeira Jetsons, Evicts Them from 1st 

London Knights (eighth place, 5-5, 991.10 points) knocks Limeira Jetsons (6-4, 1,112.06 points) out of first place after beating them 71.70 to 66.08. Limeira Jetsons could not get off the starting blocks and ranked 14th in points this week. London Knights took a 32.20-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. This win was a bit of revenge for London Knights following a difficult postseason defeat last year to Limeira Jetsons. The margin could have been bigger as London Knights had a starter score zero points (Michael Pittman).

 Unfortunately for Limeira Jetsons, the Bengals Defense wasn't just the lone DEF to earn a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in the red.

 Brown has now led London Knights in scoring in back-to-back weeks.

 London Knights will meet top-ranked Rio Claro Farmers (7-3, 1,136.22) next week. Limeira Jetsons will take on Indaiatuba Blues (6-4, 1,088.84).

Indaiatuba Pats took a 26.80-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. Limeira Dead Rabbits just cannot match up against Indaiatuba Pats, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. To make matters worse, Limeira Dead Rabbits had three starters put up zeroes. Indaiatuba Pats (6-4, 1,104.28 points) climbs into second place and Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-6, 1,007.34 points) drops to 11th place.

 Hurts has now led Indaiatuba Pats in scoring for four consecutive weeks.
