## Matchups Recap

### Goncalves Miners Snatches One from Paulinia Robots and Hands Them 4th Straight Loss 

Goncalves Miners (3-6, 841.04 points) beat Paulinia Robots (4-5, 1,002.58 points) 123.22 to 112.22 in a matchup with three lead changes. They also put up the highest point total they've scored this season. Goncalves Miners scored the bulk of their points, and had an 80.30 to 58.40 advantage, during the early games on Sunday. After the late Sunday games, they lost that lead and fell behind by 0.92. However, Goncalves Miners took the lead for good during the Bills/Bengals game on Sunday night.

 Walker had plenty of opportunities for Paulinia Robots, but could only manage 17 total yards on 10 touches.

 Burrow has now led Goncalves Miners in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last five. To go along with the fantasy victory, Goncalves Miners was savvy enough to pick winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Zach Charbonnet was the only one that played on a losing NFL team this week.

 Next week, Goncalves Miners will meet Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-6, 928.72). Paulinia Robots plays league-leader Campinas Giants (7-2, 1,046.48).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Wins Against Sorocaba Steelers 

Sorocaba Wild Mules got the third-highest player points this week from Dak Prescott with 28.36 points (374 Pas Yds, 3 TD) to get the win over Sorocaba Steelers 128.96 to 122.40. Even though both teams met their expectations, Sorocaba Wild Mules put up 10.0% more than their projected 117.22 points to secure the win. Sorocaba Steelers also had a notable player as C.J. Stroud brought in the highest score in the league this week with 41.80 points (470 Pas Yds, 1 2PT, 5 TD). Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-4, 1,039.04 points) falls to seventh place and Sorocaba Steelers (1-8, 936.02 points) stays mired in the cellar.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left points out on the field. On the winning side, Breece Hall got 20 touches but only tallied 60 total yards, while Jerome Ford managed just 77 yards on 25 touches for Sorocaba Steelers. There are a couple of spots where Sorocaba Steelers wishes they could go back and change the past, as DeVonta Smith could have started in place of George Pickens and Gus Edwards in place of Isiah Pacheco. Either of those point differentials would've altered the outcome.

 Prescott has now led Sorocaba Wild Mules in scoring twice in the last four weeks, joining A.J. Brown, the team's leading scorer in Week 7 (with 29.70 points) and Week 8 (with 33.00 points).

 Sorocaba Wild Mules has a tough one in Week 10 when they go up against London Knights (6-3, 1,058.78), who averages a league-leading 117.64 points per game. Sorocaba Steelers gets Amparo Bikers (4-5, 924.32).

### Amparo Bikers Beats Indaiatuba Riders to Grab 9th Place 

Amparo Bikers beat Indaiatuba Riders, who could not get off the starting blocks this week, 90.18 to 65.80. Amparo Bikers took a 29.20-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. While each team failed to meet expectations, Amparo Bikers scored 86.4% of their projected 104.37 points to get the win. Dalton Kincaid (acquired via free agency in Week 8) made a big impact, posting 16.10 points. Both sides missed scoring opportunities as Amparo Bikers had one starter turn in zero points and Indaiatuba Riders also had one. Amparo Bikers (4-5, 924.32 points) climbs into ninth place and Indaiatuba Riders (4-5, 971.68 points) drops to 10th place.

 Darrell Henderson had plenty of chances for Amparo Bikers, but he logged just 35 total yards on 12 touches.

 Since Henry was the top point-getter for Amparo Bikers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 21.80 points, Kyren Williams paced the squad in Week 6, while Jakobi Meyers (18.00 points) was tops in Week 7 and Jaylen Waddle (25.10 points) last week.

 In Week 10, Amparo Bikers faces the last-place team in the league, Sorocaba Steelers (1-8, 936.02). Indaiatuba Riders will take on Rio Claro Farmers (6-3, 1,030.64).

### Powered by Stars, Indaiatuba Pats Beats Up Rio Claro Farmers 

The trio of CeeDee Lamb, Rachaad White, and Joshua Dobbs led the way, as Indaiatuba Pats tore apart Rio Claro Farmers 133.82 to 86.50. That threesome combined to score 80.92 points, clearly outperforming the top scorers from Rio Claro Farmers (Amari Cooper, Baker Mayfield, and Joe Mixon), who totaled 61.70 points. Lamb racked up 191 yards, adding 28.10 points (191 Rec Yds). White delivered two touchdowns to contribute 27.90 points (73 Rsh Yds, 46 Rec Yds, 2 TD), while Dobbs chipped in 24.92 points (158 Pas Yds, 66 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD). White also recorded his highest point total of the season. With 133.82 points, Indaiatuba Pats had the top total in the league this week. Indaiatuba Pats (5-4, 1,034.14 points) climbs into sixth place, while Rio Claro Farmers (6-3, 1,030.64 points) drops to fourth place.

 Singletary had plenty of opportunities for Rio Claro Farmers, but could only manage 26 total yards on 15 touches.

 Since Lamb was the leading point-getter for Indaiatuba Pats, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 20.70 points, Logan Thomas paced the squad in Week 5, while Keenan Allen put up 21.50 points to lead the way in Week 6. Puka Nacua (23.40 points) was tops in Week 7 and Rachaad White (17.90 points) led last week. Also, with 16 targets this week for Lamb, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Indaiatuba Pats plays Limeira Jetsons (7-2, 1,029.44) in Week 10, while Rio Claro Farmers gets Indaiatuba Riders (4-5, 971.68).

### London Knights Beats Barao Butchers to Move into 3rd Place 

London Knights got past Barao Butchers, who found it difficult to put points on the board, 101.48 to 76.38. Barao Butchers is now on a three-game losing streak. Austin Ekeler led Barao Butchers with 21.00 points (47 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) while Najee Harris racked up 15.60 (69 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). Adding insult to injury, Barao Butchers received no points from Gabe Davis. London Knights (6-3, 1,058.78 points) climbs into third place and Barao Butchers (5-4, 921.58 points) stays in fifth place.

 Along with being the one defense to earn a negative score, the New York Giants DEF (on Barao Butchers) represented the lone starter in the whole league in negative territory. Additionally, they had a rather important player that left points out on the field. Despite being targeted seven times, Austin Ekeler could only manage two catches.

 In addition to the fantasy W, London Knights was savvy enough to choose winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, DJ Moore was the only one whose NFL team didn't win this past week. Hurts has now led London Knights in scoring for three straight weeks.

 London Knights takes on Sorocaba Wild Mules (5-4, 1,039.04) next week, while Barao Butchers matches up against Indaiatuba Blues (3-6, 869.34).

Limeira Jetsons took a 22.00-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Having won six straight, Limeira Jetsons has been unstoppable. Sam Howell (acquired via free agency in Week 5) made a big impact, posting 17.70 points. Limeira Jetsons started one player with zero points while Limeira Dead Rabbits also served up one goose egg, meaning both teams could have scored more points. Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-6, 928.72 points) drops to 11th place and Limeira Jetsons (7-2, 1,029.44 points) remains in second place.

 Miles Sanders really deserved more touches for Limeira Dead Rabbits, as he put up a whopping 61 total yards on just nine touches.

 While Travis Etienne led Limeira Jetsons with 25.90 points in Week 8, the Browns Defense paced the squad this week with 23.00.

### Indaiatuba Blues Brings Down Campinas Giants

Indaiatuba Blues (3-6, 869.34 points) remains in 13th place and Campinas Giants (7-2, 1,046.48 points) stays in first place.

 There was one fairly important player on Indaiatuba Blues that missed out on some chances. Despite being targeted seven times, Cooper Kupp could only manage two catches.

 Since Schultz was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Blues, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 27.80 points, Cooper Kupp paced the squad in Week 6, while Rashee Rice (17.00 points) was tops in Week 7 and Taysom Hill (22.46 points) last week.
