### Powered by a Signature Performance from George Pickens, Sorocaba Wild Mules Comes Back to Beat Indaiatuba Blues 

The production of George Pickens played a key factor, as Sorocaba Wild Mules snatched a win from Indaiatuba Blues 114.44 to 97.06.

### Limeira Jetsons Rallies Late to Beat Indaiatuba Riders, Notches 5th in a Row 

Limeira Jetsons got 18.20 points from Kenneth Gainwell (92 Rsh Yds, 30 Rec Yds) and 17.14 from Trevor Lawrence (256 Pas Yds, 29 Rsh Yds, 3 TD/3 Int), taking down Indaiatuba Riders 103.34 to 93.26. Limeira Jetsons came into the Sunday night game facing a 17.86-point deficit, but scored 27.70 for the comeback victory. This matchup included three lead changes, with the largest lead being 33.90 points after Sunday afternoon. Limeira Jetsons is a tough opponent for anyone after winning their last five matchups. On top of the loss, Indaiatuba Riders had a starter score zero points (Bucky Irving). Limeira Jetsons (7-5, 1,258.24 points) remains in seventh place and Indaiatuba Riders (2-10, 1,075.12 points) stays in 14th place.

 Each squad had a fairly important starter that missed out on some chances. For Limeira Jetsons, Tetairoa McMillan saw a total of seven targets, but was only able to reel in two catches. Tre Tucker put on a similar showing for Indaiatuba Riders, as he was only able to snag three passes on 10 targets.

 Since Gainwell was the high scorer for Limeira Jetsons, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the last six weeks. With 17.64 points, Trevor Lawrence paced the squad in Week 7, while Troy Franklin (26.90 points) was team-leader in Week 8 and Puka Nacua (22.80 points) led the way in Week 9. Kyren Williams (22.40 points) was tops in Week 10 and Tetairoa McMillan (33.00 points) led in Week 11.

 Next week, Limeira Jetsons squares off against Sorocaba Steelers (3-9, 1,138.98), while Indaiatuba Riders matches up with Holambra Dutch (2-10, 947.96).

### Amparo Bikers Wins Against London Knights, Tacks On 4th Consecutive Win 

Amparo Bikers put up the second-highest score this week to take down London Knights 131.32 to 92.56. Amparo Bikers took an 8.50-point lead on Thursday and never looked back.

Amparo Bikers (6-6, 1,426.76 points) climbs into eighth place and London Knights (5-7, 1,187.60 points) stays in 11th place.

 Michael Carter really deserved more touches for London Knights, as he put up a whopping 58 total yards on just eight touches.

 Amparo Bikers squares off against Indaiatuba Blues (6-6, 1,248.22) next week, while London Knights gets Rio Claro Farmers (8-4, 1,267.80).

### Rio Claro Farmers Gets Victory Against Sorocaba Steelers to Move into 4th Place 

Jalen Hurts scored two touchdowns (30.86 points) and Bijan Robinson added 14.70 points as Rio Claro Farmers got past Sorocaba Steelers 88.56 to 84.12. A late push in prime time on Monday Night Football (24.10 MNF points, 29% of their final score) wasn't meant to be for Sorocaba Steelers. Rio Claro Farmers took a 27.08-point lead on Sunday afternoon and maintained that advantage for the rest of the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago. Rio Claro Farmers (8-4, 1,267.80 points) climbs into fourth place and Sorocaba Steelers (3-9, 1,138.98 points) stays in 12th place.

 Devin Singletary had plenty of chances for Rio Claro Farmers, but he logged just 47 total yards on 14 touches.

 Since Hurts was the top point-getter for Rio Claro Farmers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 27.24 points, Jaxson Dart paced the squad in Week 9, while Kimani Vidal (17.80 points) was tops in Week 10 and Bijan Robinson (30.30 points) last week.

 Rio Claro Farmers gets London Knights (5-7, 1,187.60) in Week 13, while Sorocaba Steelers faces Limeira Jetsons (7-5, 1,258.24).

### Holambra Dutch Gets Victory Against BroncosLoucura 

Dak Prescott passed for 354 yards (27.06 points) and DJ Moore scored two touchdowns (23.40 points) as Holambra Dutch beat BroncosLoucura 82.56 to 76.92. Holambra Dutch took a 13.90-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. Holambra Dutch piled up 39.0% more points than projected (59.38) while BroncosLoucura performed poorly and got just 73.7% of their projected 104.33 points. Both teams left points off the scoreboard as Holambra Dutch had four starters turn in zero points and BroncosLoucura had one. Holambra Dutch (2-10, 947.96 points) remains in 15th place and BroncosLoucura (5-7, 1,311.78 points) stays in 10th place.

 Rico Dowdle probably deserved more touches for BroncosLoucura, as he put up a whopping 74 total yards on just 10 touches.

 Holambra Dutch lucked out that BroncosLoucura's top QB was on his bye week, since Tyler Shough earned just 7.92 points. If Marcus Mariota (14.32 points per game this year) was active and scored his per-game average, Holambra Dutch would've been beaten by 0.76 points. Prescott has now led Holambra Dutch in scoring in back-to-back weeks.

 In Week 13, Holambra Dutch takes on Indaiatuba Riders (2-10, 1,075.12), while BroncosLoucura gets Niners BH (3-9, 1,109.46).

### Indaiatuba Pats Lights Up Campinas Giants for 5th Consecutive Win 

Indaiatuba Pats got 27.20 points from Christian McCaffrey (89 Rsh Yds, 53 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 23.20 from Davante Adams (62 Rec Yds, 2 TD) to demolish Campinas Giants 120.76 to 70.82. This beating was revenge for a loss to Campinas Giants in their last meeting a season ago. Campinas Giants was led by James Cook with 21.90 points (116 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) and Bam Knight, who scored 13.20 (12 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). The gap could have been wider as Indaiatuba Pats had a starter score zero points (Josh Jacobs). Campinas Giants (8-4, 1,287.90 points) drops to sixth place and Indaiatuba Pats (11-1, 1,478.18 points) remains in second place.

 Knight had plenty of opportunities for Campinas Giants, but could only manage 32 total yards on 14 touches.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Indaiatuba Pats was savvy enough to select winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, DK Metcalf was the only one whose NFL team lost in Week 12. McCaffrey has now led Indaiatuba Pats in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last four.

 Indaiatuba Pats plays Limeira Dead Rabbits (8-4, 1,378.74) in Week 13, while Campinas Giants faces Sorocaba Wild Mules (9-3, 1,359.64).
