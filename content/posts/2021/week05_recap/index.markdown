### Amparo Bikers Snatches Win from Limeira Jetsons to Move into 4th Place 

Amparo Bikers was clutch under the lights with 58.70 points on Sunday Night Football (48% of their total score) to steal the victory from Limeira Jetsons 122.70 to 103.48. The late heroics were somewhat unexpected, since they were originally projected to score 46.07 points on Sunday night. Amparo Bikers was led by Josh Allen this week (315 Pas Yds, 59 Rsh Yds, 3 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD). Allen passed for 315 yards and contributed 36.50 points to the cause. Ezekiel Elliott also chipped in 25.20 points on two touchdowns (110 Rsh Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). With Kalif Raymond delivering zero points for Amparo Bikers, the gap could have been wider. Amparo Bikers (3-2, 581.68 points) climbs into fourth place, while Limeira Jetsons (3-2, 550.76 points) drops to seventh place.

 Jeremy McNichols probably deserved more touches for Limeira Jetsons, as he put up a whopping 35 total yards on just three touches.

### London Knights Tramples Sorocaba Steelers, Climbs to 13th Place 

London Knights had an excellent primetime performance with 73.60 points on Monday Night Football (41% of their total score) to easily defeat Sorocaba Steelers 177.90 to 102.28. The late heroics were especially impressive, as they were originally projected to put up just 26.17 points on Monday night. London Knights was led by Mark Andrews this week (147 Rec Yds, 2 TD). The Baltimore TE scored two touchdowns and provided 41.70 points in the blowout. Jonathan Taylor also pitched in with 31.90 points with two touchdowns (53 Rsh Yds, 116 Rec Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). The margin could have been bigger as London Knights had a starter score zero points (Julio Jones). London Knights had their top overall score of the season, while also recording the biggest margin of victory in the league this season. London Knights (1-4, 630.08 points) climbs into 13th place, while Sorocaba Steelers (1-4, 505.26 points) sinks into last place.

 With 13 targets this week for Andrews, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 London Knights has a tough one next week when they go up against Paulinia Robots (4-1, 681.90), who averages a league-leading 136.38 points per game. Sorocaba Steelers takes on Indaiatuba Blues (2-3, 588.32).

### Indaiatuba Pats Wins Against Campinas Giants to Grab 6th Place 

A primetime comeback on Monday Night Football (73.78 points, 58% of their total score) wasn't enough for Campinas Giants, as Indaiatuba Pats pulled out the 133.74 to 127.68 victory. The late-match efforts were impressive, considering their pregame projections only called for 44.11 points on Monday night. Indaiatuba Pats was led by Tom Brady (411 Pas Yds, 5 TD). Brady passed for five touchdowns and added 37.74 points to the cause. If Campinas Giants didn't have both Kenny Golladay and Chris Carson put up zeroes, the outcome could have gone the other way. Indaiatuba Pats (3-2, 602.32 points) climbs into sixth place, while Campinas Giants (2-3, 514.06 points) steps into eighth place.

 One spot where Campinas Giants really made a regrettable decision is WR. Allen Robinson could have started in place of Golladay, and that point difference would have been enough to earn the win.

 In Week 6, Indaiatuba Pats gets Barao Butchers (3-2, 585.66), while Campinas Giants matches up with Indaiatuba Riders (3-2, 607.50).

### Powered by a Signature Performance from Austin Ekeler, Limeira Dead Rabbits Beats Barao Butchers 

The output of Austin Ekeler made a decisive impact, as Limeira Dead Rabbits beat Barao Butchers 124.92 to 98.14. In the 26.78-point victory for Limeira Dead Rabbits, Ekeler went off for 32.90 points. He scored three touchdowns as part of his huge game (66 Rsh Yds, 53 Rec Yds, 2 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). He also recorded his highest point total of the season. Limeira Dead Rabbits (5-0, 649.40 points) climbs into first place, while Barao Butchers (3-2, 585.66 points) drops to fifth place.

 Conner had plenty of opportunities for Barao Butchers, but could only manage 37 total yards on 11 touches.

 In addition to the fantasy W, Limeira Dead Rabbits was savvy enough to select winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, D.J. Moore is the only one that didn't play on a winning NFL team in Week 5.

 Limeira Dead Rabbits plays Sorocaba Wild Mules (2-3, 592.84) next week, while Barao Butchers gets Indaiatuba Pats (3-2, 602.32).
