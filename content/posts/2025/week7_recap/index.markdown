### Amparo Bikers Beats Niners BH, Extends Their Losing Streak 

Amparo Bikers picked up 18.80 points from Javonte Williams (116 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) and 16.00 from Brandon Aubrey to beat Niners BH 106.42 to 75.24. After losing their sixth straight, Niners BH is all but finished. Niners BH was led by Patrick Mahomes with 26.24 points (286 Pas Yds, 28 Rsh Yds, 3 TD) and Tez Johnson, who scored 15.80 (58 Rec Yds, 1 TD). To make matters worse, Niners BH had a starter score zero points (George Kittle). Amparo Bikers (2-5, 816.68 points) remains in 12th place and Niners BH (1-6, 649.10 points) stays in 14th place.

 There were three starters that missed out on opportunities for Amparo Bikers. Even though Theo Johnson, Drake London, and Nico Collins saw a total of 27 combined targets, they were able to reel in just 11 catches between them.

 The high scorer for Amparo Bikers has flip-flopped the past few weeks. Drake London led the team with 25.00 points in Week 4 and 31.80 points matches, while Williams led the way in Week 5 (with 26.90 points) and then again this week.

### Campinas Giants Beats Sorocaba Steelers, Tacks On 7th Consecutive Win 

Campinas Giants picked up the third-highest player point total this week from Ja'Marr Chase with 38.10 points (161 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to beat Sorocaba Steelers 96.00 to 86.92. Campinas Giants took a 38.10-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Sorocaba Steelers just cannot match up against Campinas Giants, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series. Adding insult to injury, Sorocaba Steelers had a starter score zero points (Mike Evans). Campinas Giants (7-0, 809.92 points) climbs into second place and Sorocaba Steelers (3-4, 696.58 points) drops to 10th place.

 On Campinas Giants, Tua Tagovailoa represented one of two total starters in the league to tally a negative score (and the lone QB to do so ). There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but missed out on opportunities. On the winning side, Chuba Hubbard got 16 touches but only tallied 55 total yards, while Alvin Kamara had an even weaker average, managing just 29 yards on 14 touches for Sorocaba Steelers. A spot where Sorocaba Steelers wishes they could go back and change the past is WR. Marquise Brown could have started in place of Evans, and that point difference would have changed the outcome.

 Campinas Giants was very fortunate that Sorocaba Steelers's top QB had a bye this week, since Bryce Young only put up 10.52 points. If Lamar Jackson (23.34 points per game this year) was in the lineup and scored his average, Campinas Giants would have lost by 3.74 points. Chase has now led Campinas Giants in scoring in three straight weeks, and for three of the last five. Also, with 23 targets this week for Chase, it means that his targets have now increased in four consecutive games.

 Campinas Giants will face London Knights (4-3, 704.12) next week. Sorocaba Steelers plays Limeira Dead Rabbits (5-2, 848.62), who is averaging an impressive 121.23 points per game.

### Powered by a Signature Performance from Michael Pittman, Rio Claro Farmers Rallies Late to Beat Holambra Dutch 

The contribution of Michael Pittman made a decisive impact, as Rio Claro Farmers rallied late to beat Holambra Dutch 112.74 to 95.06. In the 17.68-point victory for Rio Claro Farmers, Pittman blew up for 20.80 points. With 24.04 and 21.20 points, respectively, Jalen Hurts (326 Pas Yds, 3 TD) and Bijan Robinson (40 Rsh Yds, 52 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD) topped the scoring for the winners. Pittman also recorded his highest point total of the season. With Luke McCaffrey delivering zero points for Rio Claro Farmers, the margin could have been larger. Rio Claro Farmers (5-2, 796.72 points) climbs into fourth place, while Holambra Dutch (0-7, 592.78 points) steps into 15th place.

 Kimani Vidal had plenty of chances for Rio Claro Farmers, but he logged just 35 total yards on 13 touches.

 While Bijan Robinson led Rio Claro Farmers in Weeks 4 and 6, Hurts has now been the team's high scorer in three of the past five weeks.

 Rio Claro Farmers takes on Niners BH (1-6, 649.10) next week, while Holambra Dutch battles Limeira Jetsons (2-5, 753.48).

### London Knights Pulls Off Comeback over Indaiatuba Blues, Drops Them into 6th Place 

London Knights (4-3, 704.12 points) beat Indaiatuba Blues (5-2, 715.28 points) 97.26 to 92.08 in a back-and-forth battle. They were led by A.J. Brown's 28.10 points, off of his two touchdowns (121 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and Tyler Warren (69 Rec Yds, 1 TD), who had 16.90. Indaiatuba Blues began the Sunday games already ahead 21.60 to 19.00. After the late Sunday games, they lost that lead and fell behind 87.46 to 83.58. The lead shifted again during the Falcons/49ers game on Sunday night, and Indaiatuba Blues went up by a 0.12-point margin. However, London Knights recovered for the win on Monday night, with Emeka Egbuka scoring 9.80 points during the Buccaneers/Lions game.

 Jacory Croskey-Merritt had plenty of chances for London Knights, but he logged just 33 total yards on 14 touches.

 Since Brown was the top point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 27.50 points, Omarion Hampton paced the squad in Week 4, while Emeka Egbuka (31.30 points) was tops in Week 5 and Tyler Warren (18.30 points) in Week 6. Additionally, with 10 targets this week for Tee Higgins, it means that his targets have now increased in four consecutive games.

 London Knights faces Campinas Giants (7-0, 809.92) next week. Indaiatuba Blues takes on Paulinia Robots (7-0, 917.56), who sits in first place.

### BroncosLoucura Gets Late Win over Indaiatuba Pats in Battle Between Two Most Electric Teams 

This week's second- and fourth-highest-scoring teams met in a shootout as BroncosLoucura came back to defeat Indaiatuba Pats 138.94 to 120.44. This is the fourth-most a team has scored this season without getting the victory. Indaiatuba Pats falls to 6-1 (3rd place) and snaps a six-game winning streak. The scoring output from BroncosLoucura was unexpected given that they were only projected to score 106.40 points. Indaiatuba Pats scored 105.1% of their expected 114.60. Trey McBride (74 Rec Yds, 2 TD) logged 29.40 points and Jordan Addison (128 Rec Yds) scored 21.80 points, exceeding their projections by 116.2% and 108.6%, respectively. Christian McCaffrey (129 Rsh Yds, 72 Rec Yds, 2 TD) put up the second-highest point total of the week (39.10) and Davante Adams scored 26.50 points for Indaiatuba Pats.

 On Indaiatuba Pats, the Jacksonville Jaguars DEF represented one of two total league starters to tally a negative score (and the only DEF in the negatives). Saquon Barkley had several opportunities for BroncosLoucura, but could only manage 44 total yards on 19 touches.

 While Rico Dowdle led BroncosLoucura with 33.90 points in Week 6, McBride paced the squad this week with 29.40.

 BroncosLoucura takes on Sorocaba Wild Mules (4-3, 795.16) next week, while Indaiatuba Pats faces Indaiatuba Riders (1-6, 691.88).
