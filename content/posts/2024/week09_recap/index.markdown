## Matchups Recap

### Sorocaba Steelers Beats Paulinia Robots, Finally Beats Them 

In a shootout between the first- and third-highest-scoring teams of the week, Sorocaba Steelers took down Paulinia Robots 133.20 to 125.40. This is the fifth-most a team has scored this season without getting the victory. Paulinia Robots falls to 8th (5-4) in the standings. Sorocaba Steelers (5-4) has the second-highest points per game average at 116.99. However, the score from Sorocaba Steelers was a bit surprising given that they were only expected to score 97.23 points. Paulinia Robots scored 122.5% of their projected 102.36. DeAndre Hopkins (86 Rec Yds, 2 TD) put up 28.60 points and Cedric Tillman (75 Rec Yds, 1 TD) scored 19.50 points, exceeding their projections by 159.3% and 89.0%, respectively. Jaxon Smith-Njigba (180 Rec Yds, 2 TD) registered the fifth-highest score on the season (37.00) and Lamar Jackson scored 23.60 points for Paulinia Robots.

 There was one player on Paulinia Robots that failed to capitalize on opportunites. Despite being targeted 10 times, Dalton Kincaid could manage just four catches. A position where Paulinia Robots wishes they could go back and change the past is wide receiver. Ladd McConkey could have started in place of Puka Nacua, and that point difference would've ultimately changed the outcome.

 While Joe Mixon led Sorocaba Steelers with 23.40 points last week, Hopkins paced the squad this week with 28.60.

 In Week 10, Sorocaba Steelers meets Rio Claro Farmers (6-3, 1,026.68). Paulinia Robots plays Limeira Jetsons (6-3, 1,045.98), who sits in first place.
