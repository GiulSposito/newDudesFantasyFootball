## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Gets Victory Against Indaiatuba Blues to Grab 3rd Place 

Paulinia Robots got 26.04 points from Justin Fields (151 Pas Yds, 60 Rsh Yds, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) and 20.10 from Brandon Aiyuk (81 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to get the win over Indaiatuba Blues 117.80 to 102.08. This win was revenge for a loss to Indaiatuba Blues in their last meeting a season ago. Indaiatuba Blues was led by Nick Chubb with 25.40 points (101 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 2 TD) and Kirk Cousins, who scored 23.48 (232 Pas Yds, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD). Paulinia Robots (6-2, 992.56 points) climbs into third place and Indaiatuba Blues (1-7, 912.98 points) stays in 13th place.

 Miles Sanders really deserved more touches for Paulinia Robots, as he put up a whopping 78 total yards on just nine touches.

 Since Fields was the leading scorer for Paulinia Robots, it means a different player has now led the team in each of the past seven matches.

 Paulinia Robots goes up against first-place Goncalves Miners (7-1, 995.28) next week. Indaiatuba Blues plays Campinas Giants (2-6, 815.38).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Picks Up Victory over Indaiatuba Riders 

Sorocaba Wild Mules got the highest score of the week and got past Indaiatuba Riders 147.60 to 110.18. Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 3.50-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Sorocaba Wild Mules has been red-hot in this matchup as of late, winning three straight against Indaiatuba Riders. Sorocaba Wild Mules (1-7, 804.88 points) remains mired in last place and Indaiatuba Riders (3-5, 867.22 points) stays in 10th place.

 In addition to the fantasy W, Sorocaba Wild Mules was savvy enough to choose winners in real football, as well. Among all of their starters, Mike Evans is the only one that suited up on a losing NFL team this week. While Mike Evans led Sorocaba Wild Mules with 18.60 points last week, Prescott paced the squad this week with 25.40. Also, with 17 touches this week for Tyler Allgeier, it means that his touches have now increased in five consecutive games.

 In Week 9, Sorocaba Wild Mules gets Sorocaba Steelers (6-2, 871.02), while Indaiatuba Riders faces Amparo Bikers (3-5, 886.42).

### Indaiatuba Pats Comes Back on Amparo Bikers, Notches 3rd in a Row 

Indaiatuba Pats took advantage of the third-highest player point total this week from A.J. Brown with 39.60 points (156 Rec Yds, 3 TD) and erased a 2.16-point deficit on Monday night, defeating Amparo Bikers 131.24 to 125.10. This matchup saw three lead changes, with the largest lead being 32.36 points after Sunday evening. Indaiatuba Pats has now won three straight matchups. Indaiatuba Pats (6-2, 964.76 points) remains in second place and Amparo Bikers (3-5, 886.42 points) stays in ninth place.

 There was one notable starter on Indaiatuba Pats that failed to capitalize on opportunites. Even though Gabe Davis saw a total of seven targets, he only reeled in two catches.

 Indaiatuba Pats was very lucky that Amparo Bikers's best RB was off this week, considering Latavius Murray could only put up 12.90 points. If Austin Ekeler (24.96 points per game this season) was active and scored his per-game average, Indaiatuba Pats would have lost by 5.92 points. Since Brown was the leading point-getter for Indaiatuba Pats, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 33.22 points, Jared Goff paced the squad in Week 4, while Gabe Davis put up 32.10 points to lead the way in Week 5. Rhamondre Stevenson (25.10 points) was tops in Week 6 and Daniel Jones (28.78 points) led last week.

 Indaiatuba Pats squares off against Rio Claro Farmers (6-2, 951.98) next week, while Amparo Bikers gets Indaiatuba Riders (3-5, 867.22).

### Powered by Their Big Three, Sorocaba Steelers Squashes Barao Butchers 

Led by the triple threat of Derrick Henry, Tyreek Hill, and Travis Etienne, Sorocaba Steelers tore apart Barao Butchers 127.34 to 83.48. That threesome combined to tally 92.50 points, surpassing the total of Barao Butchers. Henry rushed for 219 yards, accumulating 35.80 points (219 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). Meanwhile, Hill delivered 188 receiving yards (31.50 points) and Etienne rushed for 156 yards (25.20 points). Also, Henry recorded his highest point total of the season. With George Pickens delivering zero points for Sorocaba Steelers, the margin could have been bigger. Sorocaba Steelers (6-2, 871.02 points) climbs into fourth place, while Barao Butchers (2-6, 751.62 points) stays in 12th place.

 On Sorocaba Steelers, the Pittsburgh Steelers DEF wasn't just the one defense to post a negative score; they represented the lone fantasy starter throughout the entire league in negative territory.

 While Tyreek Hill led Sorocaba Steelers in Week 6 (with 29.70 points) and JuJu Smith-Schuster in Week 7 (25.40 points), Henry has now been the team's top point-getter twice in the past four weeks.

 Next week, Sorocaba Steelers will meet the last-place team in the league, Sorocaba Wild Mules (1-7, 804.88). Barao Butchers will square off against London Knights (4-4, 726.06).

### Behind a Sizzling Showing from Alvin Kamara, Rio Claro Farmers Tops Limeira Dead Rabbits

In the 26.12-point triumph for Rio Claro Farmers, Kamara heated up for 42.80 points. He scored three touchdowns as part of his huge game (62 Rsh Yds, 96 Rec Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 2 Rec TD). He also recorded the second-highest point total in the league this season. Each team left something on the table as Rio Claro Farmers had one starter turn in zero points and Limeira Dead Rabbits also had one. Rio Claro Farmers (6-2, 951.98 points) falls to fifth place, while Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-4, 859.30 points) stays in seventh place.

### London Knights Picks Up Victory over Campinas Giants, Extends Their Losing Streak 

London Knights recorded the highest score they've earned all season to get the win over Campinas Giants 130.38 to 117.20. This win was revenge for a loss to Campinas Giants in their last meeting a season ago. Christian McCaffrey brought in the second-highest score in the league this week with 40.26 points (94 Rsh Yds, 55 Rec Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Pas TD, 1 Rec TD) for Campinas Giants. London Knights started one player with zero points while Campinas Giants also served up one goose egg, meaning both teams left points off the scoreboard. London Knights (4-4, 726.06 points) remains in eighth place and Campinas Giants (2-6, 815.38 points) stays in 11th place.

 Officially two months into the fantasy season, London Knights has yet to see a duplicate top weekly scorer.

 In Week 9, London Knights plays Barao Butchers (2-6, 751.62), while Campinas Giants goes up against Indaiatuba Blues (1-7, 912.98).

### Goncalves Miners Steals One from Limeira Jetsons for 6th in a Row 

Goncalves Miners picked up 33.90 points from DeAndre Hopkins (159 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 22.10 from Amari Cooper (131 Rec Yds, 1 TD), defeating Limeira Jetsons 131.58 to 115.68. Goncalves Miners came into the Monday night game facing a 5.78-point deficit, but scored 35.58 for the comeback victory. This matchup included three lead changes, with the largest lead being 50.40 points after Sunday afternoon. This stunner was revenge for a loss to Limeira Jetsons in their last meeting a season ago. Limeira Jetsons (5-3, 941.84 points) drops to sixth place and Goncalves Miners (7-1, 995.28 points) remains in first place.

 Alexander Mattison really deserved more touches for Goncalves Miners, as he put up a whopping 40 total yards on just five touches. One position where Limeira Jetsons really made a painful call is running back. Jamaal Williams could have started in place of Darrell Henderson, and that point difference would've altered the outcome.

 While Joe Burrow led Goncalves Miners with 39.24 points in Week 7, Hopkins paced the squad this week with 33.90.

 Goncalves Miners will have to step up their game next week when they go up against Paulinia Robots (6-2, 992.56), who averages an impressive 124.07 points per game. Limeira Jetsons takes on Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-4, 859.30).
