## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Beats Up Limeira Dead Rabbits, Extends Undefeated Record Versus Them to 2-0 

Paulinia Robots got the highest player point total this week from Lamar Jackson with 34.44 points (281 Pas Yds, 52 Rsh Yds, 5 TD), destroying Limeira Dead Rabbits 117.64 to 62.64. Paulinia Robots took a 10.66-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. Limeira Dead Rabbits just cannot match up against Paulinia Robots, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Kareem Hunt (acquired via free agency in Week 3) made a big impact, posting 22.30 points. On top of the loss, Limeira Dead Rabbits got zero points from both Chris Olave and Luke Musgrave. Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-4, 717.32 points) drops to 11th place and Paulinia Robots (5-2, 847.70 points) remains in second place.

 For Paulinia Robots, the Jets Defense wasn't just the lone DEF to post a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league to do so.

 Jackson has now led Paulinia Robots in scoring in consecutive weeks.

 Paulinia Robots goes up against London Knights (4-3, 726.56) next week. Limeira Dead Rabbits gets Indaiatuba Riders (1-6, 655.94), who sits in last place.

### Sorocaba Steelers Brings Down Sorocaba Wild Mules to Capture 4th Place 

A primetime rally on Monday Night Football (39.90 points, 44% of their total score) wasn't enough for Sorocaba Wild Mules, as Sorocaba Steelers got the 106.42 to 91.00 victory. Sorocaba Steelers was led by Joe Mixon (115 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). The Houston RB scored two touchdowns and added 26.40 points to the effort. Sorocaba Steelers (4-3, 808.70 points) climbs into fourth place, while Sorocaba Wild Mules (3-4, 701.04 points) steps into ninth place.

 Since Mixon was the leading point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 20.70 points, Zack Moss paced the squad in Week 3, while Justin Fields put up 31.98 points to lead the way in Week 4. Brock Bowers (23.70 points) was tops in Week 5 and Chris Godwin (35.50 points) led in Week 6. Also, with 24 touches this week for Bijan Robinson, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

### Indaiatuba Riders Beats London Knights, First-Ever Victory Over Them 

Indaiatuba Riders took advantage of 23.60 points from David Njoku (76 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 22.10 from Brian Thomas Jr. (89 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to beat London Knights 98.08 to 85.80. Indaiatuba Riders took an 8.40-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to London Knights in their last meeting a season ago. With Cooper Kupp delivering zero points for Indaiatuba Riders, the gap could have been wider. London Knights (4-3, 726.56 points) drops to seventh place and Indaiatuba Riders (1-6, 655.94 points) remains mired in last place.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities. On the London Knights, Chase Brown got 17 touches but only tallied 53 total yards, while Alvin Kamara was even less effective, managing just 24 yards on 13 touches for Indaiatuba Riders.

 It wasn't all bad news for London Knights, as they did field a squad of real-life winners. Every starter except Mike Evans played on a victorious NFL team this week. Since Njoku was the top point-getter for Indaiatuba Riders, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 24.90 points, Alvin Kamara paced the squad in Week 4, while Tee Higgins (29.30 points) was tops in Week 5 and Brock Purdy (24.10 points) last week.

 In Week 8, Indaiatuba Riders faces Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-4, 717.32). London Knights will take on Paulinia Robots (5-2, 847.70), who is averaging a league-leading 121.10 points per game.

### Rio Claro Farmers Picks Up Win Against Amparo Bikers, Grabs 3rd Place 

Rio Claro Farmers benefited from 17.78 points from Geno Smith (207 Pas Yds, 2 TD) and 17.20 from James Conner (101 Rsh Yds, 51 Rec Yds) to beat Amparo Bikers 119.58 to 113.04. Rio Claro Farmers has beaten expectations an admirable five weeks straight and put up 17.9% more points than their 101.46 projected in this matchup. Amparo Bikers just doesn't have what it takes to beat Rio Claro Farmers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. The outcome could have gone the other way had Amparo Bikers not had a starter score zero points (Deebo Samuel Sr.). Rio Claro Farmers (5-2, 802.50 points) climbs into third place and Amparo Bikers (4-3, 754.82 points) stays in sixth place.

 Chuba Hubbard had plenty of chances for Rio Claro Farmers, but he logged just 52 total yards on 17 touches.

 While Garrett Wilson led Rio Claro Farmers matches (with 24.70 points), Smith has now been the team's high scorer in two of the past three weeks.

 Next week, Rio Claro Farmers goes up against Amparo Bikers (4-3, 754.82). Amparo Bikers plays Rio Claro Farmers (5-2, 802.50).

### Limeira Jetsons Squashes Indaiatuba Blues, Streak Climbs to Five 

Limeira Jetsons destroyed Indaiatuba Blues 124.54 to 84.62 while putting up the second-highest point total this week. A late push in prime time during Monday Night Football (25.20 MNF points, 30% of their final score) wasn't enough for Indaiatuba Blues. Limeira Jetsons took a 13.50-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. Indaiatuba Blues is not on the same level as Limeira Jetsons, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series. Adding insult to injury, Indaiatuba Blues received no points from Tank Dell. Indaiatuba Blues (4-3, 771.72 points) drops to fifth place and Limeira Jetsons (6-1, 814.40 points) remains in first place.

 Jaleel McLaughlin really deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Blues, as he put up a whopping 35 total yards on just four touches.

 While Jayden Daniels led Limeira Jetsons in Week 6 with 20.96 points, Gibbs paved the way this week with 32.00.

### Holambra Dutch Gets Victory over Campinas Giants, Tacks On 3rd Straight Win 

A primetime rally on Sunday Night Football (38.30 points, 40% of their total score) wasn't enough for Campinas Giants, despite the best efforts of George Pickens (111 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Najee Harris (102 Rsh Yds, 1 TD), as Holambra Dutch got the 134.80 to 94.94 victory. The late-match efforts were a bit unexpected, considering their original Sunday night projection was only 23.09 points. Holambra Dutch was led by Saquon Barkley this week (176 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). The Philadelphia RB rushed for 176 yards and provided 26.70 points to the effort. Kenneth Walker III also helped the cause with 23.30 points on two touchdowns (69 Rsh Yds, 1 Rsh TD, 1 Rec TD). The 134.80 points represented the highest total in the league this week. Holambra Dutch (4-3, 842.82 points) falls to eighth place, while Campinas Giants (2-5, 688.86 points) stays in 12th place.

 There was one player on Campinas Giants who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Even though Xavier Worthy saw a total of eight targets, he reeled in just three catches.

 Since Barkley was the top point-getter for Holambra Dutch, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 33.60 points, Kenneth Walker III paced the squad in Week 4, while Drake London (33.40 points) was tops in Week 5 and Jordan Love (25.62 points) last week.

 Holambra Dutch will meet top-ranked Limeira Jetsons (6-1, 814.40) next week. Campinas Giants takes on Barao Butchers (1-6, 693.80).

### Indaiatuba Pats Rallies Late to Beat Barao Butchers, Moves Up to 10th Place 

Indaiatuba Pats was clutch when the lights came on with 39.80 points on Monday Night Football (41% of their total score) to pull off the comeback against Barao Butchers 97.56 to 80.36. The late heroics were a little unexpected, since they were originally projected to have 29.55 points on Monday night. Indaiatuba Pats was led by Jalen Hurts (114 Pas Yds, 1 Pas TD, 2 Rsh TD). Hurts scored two touchdowns and provided 22.76 points to the effort. Adding insult to injury, Barao Butchers had a starter score zero points (Courtland Sutton). Indaiatuba Pats (3-4, 743.76 points) climbs into 10th place, while Barao Butchers (1-6, 693.80 points) stays in 13th place.

 Since Hurts led all scorers on the winning side, it means a different player has been the top scorer on Indaiatuba Pats in every match this year.
