## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Comes Back to Beat Sorocaba Steelers, Makes It Four in a Row 

Coming off a dominant performance, Paulinia Robots (4-0, 507.76 points) wanted to keep things rolling. They accomplished that by taking down Sorocaba Steelers (3-1, 415.36 points) 98.36 to 91.68. Paulinia Robots struck first and by Sunday was already ahead 13.00 to 0.00. They surrendered that lead after the late Sunday games and were losing by 1.12. Paulinia Robots secured the comeback victory on Monday night, thanks to 7.80 points from Jaylen Waddle during the Dolphins/Jets game.

 Digging further into the numbers, Sorocaba Steelers can trace the loss back to their choice at QB, Lamar Jackson. Jackson had been projected to put up 21.01 points, actually ended up with 10.68, and that difference was enough for Paulinia Robots to seize the win.

 Paulinia Robots plays Rio Claro Farmers (3-1, 480.46) in Week 5, while Sorocaba Steelers faces London Knights (2-2, 428.00).

### Limeira Jetsons Punishes Sorocaba Wild Mules, Moves Up to 10th Place 

A rally in prime time on both Sunday Night Football and Monday Night Football wasn't nearly enough for Sorocaba Wild Mules.
