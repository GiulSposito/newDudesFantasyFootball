## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Obliterates Sorocaba Wild Mules, Seizes Career Series Lead 5-2 

With the two-man wrecking crew of Tyreek Hill and Tyler Lockett leading the charge, Paulinia Robots tore apart Sorocaba Wild Mules 161.48 to 101.78. That tandem joined forces to tally 63.10 points, clearly outperforming DeAndre Hopkins and T.J. Hockenson (52.00 combined points), the top two on Sorocaba Wild Mules. Hill racked up 197 yards, adding 37.10 points (197 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Lockett also recorded two touchdowns on his way to 26.00 points (100 Rec Yds, 2 TD). This beating was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Wild Mules in their last meeting a season ago. Sorocaba Wild Mules first-round draft pick Aaron Jones was brutal in this game, getting 4.20 points this week. To make matters worse, Sorocaba Wild Mules had a starter score zero points (the Chicago Bears DEF). Paulinia Robots starts off the campaign in first place. Sorocaba Wild Mules debuts in 11th place.

 On Sorocaba Wild Mules, Ronald Jones was one of two total league starters to post a negative score (and the only RB in the negatives).

 Paulinia Robots takes on Indaiatuba Riders (1-0, 136.18) next week, while Sorocaba Wild Mules faces Amparo Bikers (1-0, 140.40).
