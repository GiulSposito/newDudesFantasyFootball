### Barao Butchers Brings Down Amparo Bikers 

Barao Butchers got two big individual performances from Jonathan Taylor with 27.50 points (161 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) and Michael Pittman with 27.10 points (121 Rec Yds, 1 TD) to take down Amparo Bikers 110.38 to 99.06.

 One slot where Amparo Bikers really made a regrettable decision is quarterback. Ryan Tannehill could have started in place of Prescott, and that point difference would've been enough to win.
