### Sorocaba Wild Mules Picks Apart Holambra Dutch, Moves Up to 7th Place

Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 24.94-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. Holambra Dutch is not on the same level as Sorocaba Wild Mules, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Even though these teams are tied for seventh place with matching 4-4 records, Holambra Dutch has a solid lead in points, 920.76 to 829.42. Sorocaba Wild Mules started one player with zero points while Holambra Dutch also served up one goose egg, meaning both sides missed scoring opportunities.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities. On the winning side, J.K. Dobbins got 21 touches but only tallied 68 total yards, while Kenneth Walker III managed just 45 yards on 13 touches for Holambra Dutch.

 Robinson has now led Sorocaba Wild Mules in scoring for three consecutive weeks.

### Indaiatuba Riders Comes Back to Beat Rio Claro Farmers 

Facing an 18.38-point deficit on Sunday night, Indaiatuba Riders scored 26.00 to beat Rio Claro Farmers 108.60 to 100.98. They also put up the highest point total they've scored all season. This matchup saw three lead changes, with the largest lead being 18.38 points after Sunday evening. Rio Claro Farmers just cannot match up against Indaiatuba Riders, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. With Tee Higgins delivering zero points for Indaiatuba Riders, the margin could have been bigger. Indaiatuba Riders (2-6, 764.54 points) remains mired in last place and Rio Claro Farmers (5-3, 903.48 points) stays in third place.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities. On the winning side, Braelon Allen got 12 touches but only tallied 32 total yards, while James Conner managed just 69 yards on 22 touches for Rio Claro Farmers. One spot where Rio Claro Farmers is wishing they could get a do-over is QB. Sam Darnold could have started in place of Geno Smith, and that point difference would've ultimately changed the outcome.

 While David Njoku led Indaiatuba Riders matches (with 23.60 points), Purdy has now been the team's top scorer in two of the past three weeks.

 Indaiatuba Riders faces London Knights (4-4, 825.58) next week. Rio Claro Farmers squares off against Sorocaba Steelers (4-4, 919.72).

### Amparo Bikers Beats Limeira Jetsons, Moves Up to 5th Place 

Amparo Bikers (5-3, 890.08 points) beat Limeira Jetsons (6-2, 941.34 points) 135.26 to 126.94 in a matchup with three lead changes. They also put up the second-highest point total in the league this week. Amparo Bikers came into the Sunday games already in front 25.40 to 19.50. That advantage evaporated by the end of the early Sunday games and they trailed by 18.70. However, following the late Sunday games, Amparo Bikers reclaimed the lead and took home the victory.

 Unfortunately for Limeira Jetsons, the Bengals Defense wasn't just the lone defense to tally a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in negative territory. Javonte Williams got lots of opportunities for Amparo Bikers, but he only posted 52 total yards on 21 touches. One slot where Limeira Jetsons really made a painful call is wide receiver. Darnell Mooney could have started in place of Amari Cooper, and that point difference would've been enough to change the outcome.

 Since Nix was the leading scorer for Amparo Bikers, it means a different player has now led the team in each of the last seven matches. In addition to the fantasy victory, Amparo Bikers was savvy enough to choose winners in real football, too. The New Orleans Saints DEF is the only starter that wasn't part of a winning effort this past week.

 In Week 9, Amparo Bikers will match up against Indaiatuba Blues (5-3, 890.94). Limeira Jetsons gets Holambra Dutch (4-4, 920.76).

### Barao Butchers Gets Victory Against Sorocaba Steelers, Gets First-Ever Win Over Them 

A rally on Monday Night Football (42.82 points, 39% of their total score) wasn't enough for Sorocaba Steelers, as Barao Butchers got the 131.80 to 111.02 victory. The late-match efforts were impressive, considering their pregame projections only called for 24.88 points on Monday night. Barao Butchers was led by George Kittle this week, who contributed 24.80 points (128 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Rhamondre Stevenson also chipped in 23.50 points on two touchdowns (48 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 2 TD). Sorocaba Steelers (4-4, 919.72 points) drops to sixth place, while Barao Butchers (2-6, 825.60 points) remains in 13th place.

 One position where Sorocaba Steelers really made a regrettable decision is WR. Cedric Tillman could have started in place of DeAndre Hopkins, and that point difference would've ultimately changed the outcome.

 While Amon-Ra St. Brown led Barao Butchers matches (with 25.20 points), Kittle has now been the team's top scorer in two of the last three weeks. Additionally, with 29 touches this week for Joe Mixon, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Barao Butchers will meet Campinas Giants (2-6, 801.92) in Week 9. Sorocaba Steelers takes on Rio Claro Farmers (5-3, 903.48).

### Limeira Dead Rabbits Gets Victory over London Knights, Moves to 9th Place 

A rally on Sunday Night Football (39.60 points, 40% of their total score) wasn't enough for London Knights despite CeeDee Lamb's best efforts (146 Rec Yds, 2 TD), as Limeira Dead Rabbits earned the 121.20 to 99.02 victory. The late-match efforts were impressive, considering their pregame projections only called for 18.17 points on Sunday night. Limeira Dead Rabbits was led by Travis Kelce, who added 25.00 points to the total (90 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-4, 838.52 points) climbs into ninth place, while London Knights (4-4, 825.58 points) drops to 11th place.

 Brown had plenty of opportunities for London Knights, but could only manage 34 total yards on 14 touches.

Also, with 17 targets this week for Lamb, it means that his targets have now increased in four consecutive games.
