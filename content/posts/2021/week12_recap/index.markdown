## League Highlights

Goncalves Miners was projected to win by the widest margin this week (15.38 points). Not only did they lose to Indaiatuba Riders, but they lost by a bigger margin (32.08 points) than they were projected to win by.

Sorocaba Wild Mules earned the win this week despite not starting a top-30 scoring RB.

Sorocaba Wild Mules is on a six-game winning streak.

No surprise here: teams have won 75.0% of the time this season when starting the league's top-scoring QB of the week (9-3 overall).

Teams have won 53.3% of the time this season when they throw no interceptions in a week.

Unfortunately, Rio Claro Farmers fell short of their projected score for the fourth straight week.

Limeira Dead Rabbits is on a three-game winning streak.

Campinas Giants has now fallen short of their projected score for three weeks in a row.

Barao Butchers has now fallen short of their projected score for three weeks in a row.

Rio Claro Farmers probably wishes they had started Eli Mitchell. The 27.80 points he scored would have represented the fourth-highest individual score this week.

Indaiatuba Riders beat their projections by a higher percentage than anyone else in the league this week. They put up 129.90 points when they were only projected 97.31.

The 137.40 points scored by Amparo Bikers were the most this week and the 28th-highest overall in the league this season.
