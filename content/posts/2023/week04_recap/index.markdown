## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Comes Back to Beat Sorocaba Steelers for 3rd in a Row 

One week after a blowout victory, Paulinia Robots (3-1, 462.72 points) had a tougher challenge on their hands against Sorocaba Steelers (0-4, 428.50 points). It was a back-and-forth matchup, but ended with Paulinia Robots coming out on top 101.94 to 94.14. Sorocaba Steelers racked up most of their week's points, and had a 53.84 to 33.80 advantage, during the early games on Sunday. They gave up that lead after the late Sunday games and were behind 76.04 to 69.34. Josh Jacobs provided a spark for Paulinia Robots during those games, with an outstanding performance. The lead changed direction again after Isiah Pacheco scored 24.80 points during the Chiefs/Jets game on Sunday night and Sorocaba Steelers had a 94.14 to 88.04 edge. However, Paulinia Robots rallied to victory on Monday night, with the aid of 13.90 points from Kenneth Walker III during the Seahawks/Giants game.

 Unfortunately for Sorocaba Steelers, the Steelers Defense wasn't just the lone defense to earn a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in negative territory. Ford had lots of looks for Sorocaba Steelers, but could only manage 45 total yards on 14 touches.

 With 23 touches this week for Isiah Pacheco, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Next week, Paulinia Robots faces Rio Claro Farmers (4-0, 516.66), who puts up a league-leading 129.17 points per game. Sorocaba Steelers takes on London Knights (2-2, 431.46).
