Rio Claro Farmers just doesn't have what it takes to beat Indaiatuba Riders, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series.

 Pollard had plenty of opportunities for Rio Claro Farmers, but could only manage 26 total yards on 13 touches.

### Limeira Jetsons Clips BroncosLoucura for 4th Straight Win 

Limeira Jetsons picked up 33.00 points from Tetairoa McMillan (130 Rec Yds, 2 TD) and 16.60 from Kyren Williams (91 Rsh Yds, 1 TD), slipping by BroncosLoucura 109.10 to 105.82.

Puka Nacua (22.80 points) was tops in Week 9 and Kyren Williams (22.40 points) led last week.

### Holambra Dutch Gets Late Win over Barao Butchers to Grab 15th Place 

Holambra Dutch had an excellent primetime showing with 44.92 points on Monday Night Football (49% of their total score) to seal the comeback against Barao Butchers 91.92 to 79.90. The late heroics were a bit unexpected, since they were originally projected to have 36.75 points on Monday night. Holambra Dutch was led by Dak Prescott this week (268 Pas Yds, 4 TD). Prescott passed for four touchdowns and added 24.32 points to the final tally. Wil Lutz also helped the cause with 18.00 points on five field goals.

Holambra Dutch (1-10, 865.40 points) climbs into 15th place, while Barao Butchers (1-10, 946.34 points) sinks into the cellar.

 Since Prescott was the top point-getter for Holambra Dutch, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 24.10 points, RJ Harvey paced the squad in Week 8, while DJ Moore (22.98 points) was tops in Week 9 and Quentin Johnston (9.20 points) in Week 10. It wasn't all bad news for Barao Butchers, as they did field a team of real-life winners. Every starter except Cameron Dicker played on a victorious NFL team in Week 11.

 In Week 12, Holambra Dutch squares off against BroncosLoucura (5-6, 1,234.86), while Barao Butchers faces Niners BH (2-9, 998.20).
