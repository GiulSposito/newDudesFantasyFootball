## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Gets Win over Holambra Dutch, Notches 9th in a Row 

Josh Allen scored two touchdowns (28.82 points) and Jaxon Smith-Njigba added 22.00 points as Paulinia Robots got past Holambra Dutch 116.32 to 99.98. This matchup included three lead changes, with the largest lead being 50.74 points after Sunday night. With Paulinia Robots undefeated and Holambra Dutch winless, it appears that they have found different fortunes this season. Rashee Rice (acquired via free agency in Week 1) made a big impact, posting 18.60 points. Both teams could have scored more points as Paulinia Robots had one starter turn in zero points and Holambra Dutch also had one. Paulinia Robots (9-0, 1,146.60 points) remains in first place and Holambra Dutch (0-9, 748.38 points) stays locked in last place.

 RJ Harvey probably deserved more touches for Holambra Dutch, as he put up a whopping 56 total yards on just seven touches.

 Since Allen was the top point-getter for Paulinia Robots, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 30.20 points, Jaxon Smith-Njigba paced the squad in Week 6, while Jahmyr Gibbs (36.80 points) was tops in Week 7 and Rashee Rice (25.50 points) in Week 8.

This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands three times, with the largest lead being 9.62 points after Sunday afternoon. This shocker was revenge for a loss to Limeira Dead Rabbits in their last meeting a season ago. If Limeira Dead Rabbits didn't have both Rome Odunze and Travis Hunter put up zeroes, the outcome might have been different. London Knights (5-4, 908.04 points) climbs into eighth place and Limeira Dead Rabbits (6-3, 1,069.00 points) stays in fifth place.

 Jacory Croskey-Merritt had plenty of chances for London Knights, but he logged just 41 total yards on 13 touches.

 Since Brown was the high scorer for London Knights, it means that a different player has now led the team in each of the past six weeks. With 27.50 points, Omarion Hampton paced the squad in Week 4, while Emeka Egbuka (31.30 points) was team-leader in Week 5 and Tyler Warren (18.30 points) led the way in Week 6. A.J. Brown (28.10 points) was tops in Week 7 and Jordan Love (28.30 points) led last week. Also, with 19 touches this week for Chase Brown, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 London Knights gets a challenge in Week 10 when they go up against Indaiatuba Pats (8-1, 1,085.72), who averages a solid 120.64 points per game. Limeira Dead Rabbits will square off against Indaiatuba Blues (6-3, 956.74).

### Limeira Jetsons Gets Win Against Niners BH Who Drops 8th in a Row 

With the combo of Puka Nacua and Marvin Harrison Jr. leading the charge, Limeira Jetsons got a victory over Niners BH 126.50 to 94.50. That tandem joined forces to score 45.40 points, significantly outperforming Ashton Jeanty and Parker Washington (36.90 combined points), the top two on Niners BH. Nacua (95 Rec Yds, 1 TD) delivered 22.80 points, while Jr. (96 Rec Yds, 1 TD) also tacked on 22.60 for the victors. Limeira Jetsons took a 15.00-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. After dropping their last eight matchups, Niners BH should be looking toward next year. Niners BH (1-8, 842.36 points) steps into 13th place and Limeira Jetsons (4-5, 955.08 points) remains in 10th place.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Limeira Jetsons was keen enough to select winners in real life, as well. Each of their starters played on an NFL team that won in Week 9. Since Nacua was the leading point-getter for Limeira Jetsons, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 31.10 points, Kyren Williams paced the squad in Week 5, while Tetairoa McMillan put up 17.90 points to lead the way in Week 6. Trevor Lawrence (17.64 points) was tops in Week 7 and Troy Franklin (26.90 points) led last week.

 Limeira Jetsons meets Barao Butchers (1-8, 788.04) next week. Niners BH takes on Holambra Dutch (0-9, 748.38), who sits in last place.

 Woody Marks had plenty of chances for Indaiatuba Blues, but he logged just 27 total yards on 10 touches.
