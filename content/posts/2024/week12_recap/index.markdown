## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Rallies Against Campinas Giants, Notches 3rd in a Row 

Down 11.78 on Sunday night, Paulinia Robots came back, defeating Campinas Giants 124.48 to 107.98. Paulinia Robots got 22.58 points from Lamar Jackson (177 Pas Yds, 2 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) and 20.70 from Puka Nacua (117 Rec Yds). This shocker was revenge for a loss to Campinas Giants in their last meeting a season ago. Nacua (acquired via free agency in Week 1) has been a key addition for Paulinia Robots, ranking 12th among wide receivers over the last four weeks. Paulinia Robots (8-4, 1,488.62 points) remains in first place and Campinas Giants (5-7, 1,293.10 points) stays in 11th place.

 While Ja'Marr Chase led Paulinia Robots with 26.50 points in Week 11, Jackson paced the squad this week with 22.58.

 Next week, Paulinia Robots battles Sorocaba Steelers (6-6, 1,400.22), who puts up a strong 116.68 points per game. Campinas Giants will take on last-place Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-8, 1,149.40).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Picks Up Victory over London Knights for 3rd in a Row 

Sorocaba Wild Mules got 28.40 points from Jaylen Waddle (144 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 25.30 from Trey McBride (133 Rec Yds) to beat London Knights 101.30 to 83.38. London Knights just doesn't have what it takes to beat Sorocaba Wild Mules, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series. CeeDee Lamb led London Knights with 16.80 points (67 Rec Yds) while David Montgomery brought in 16.30 (37 Rsh Yds, 36 Rec Yds, 1 TD). On top of the loss, London Knights had a starter score zero points (Noah Fant). Sorocaba Wild Mules (7-5, 1,306.50 points) climbs into fourth place and London Knights (6-6, 1,205.56 points) drops to ninth place.

 For Sorocaba Wild Mules, the Rams Defense wasn't just the lone defense to post a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in the red. Each squad had a player that probably deserved to see more touches than he actually did. On the winning side, J.K. Dobbins got just nine touches but was able to log 59 all-purpose yards, while Justice Hill put up 62 yards on only six touches.

 Since Waddle was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Wild Mules, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 24.50 points, J.K. Dobbins paced the squad in Week 9, while Bijan Robinson (29.40 points) was tops in Week 10 and Justin Herbert (24.38 points) in Week 11.

### Powered by a Signature Performance from Jayden Daniels, Limeira Jetsons Gets Victory over Indaiatuba Riders 

The contribution from Jayden Daniels made the difference, as Limeira Jetsons defeated Indaiatuba Riders 71.20 to 60.36. Daniels went off for 30.40 points to top projections by 12.20, leading Limeira Jetsons to a 10.84-point victory. In addition to the Washington QB (275 Pas Yds, 74 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 2 Pas TD/2 Int, 1 Rsh TD), Jahmyr Gibbs (90 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) chipped in with 24.90 points. Daniels also recorded the second-highest point total in the league this week. The outcome could have been worse as Limeira Jetsons won despite four starters scoring zero points. Limeira Jetsons (7-5, 1,252.40 points) remains in third place, while Indaiatuba Riders (4-8, 1,167.74 points) stays in 13th place.

 Limeira Jetsons was fortunate that Indaiatuba Riders's best RB had a bye this week, considering Christian McCaffrey could only muster 7.80 points. If Alvin Kamara (19.95 points per game this season) was active and produced his average, Limeira Jetsons would've been beaten by 1.31 points. Since Daniels was the leading point-getter for Limeira Jetsons, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 25.10 points, Kyle Pitts paced the squad in Week 8, while Justin Jefferson put up 21.58 points to lead the way in Week 9. Darnell Mooney (14.60 points) was tops in Week 10 and Jahmyr Gibbs (19.30 points) led last week.

 Next week, Limeira Jetsons matches up against Indaiatuba Blues (7-5, 1,315.54). Indaiatuba Riders squares off against Barao Butchers (4-8, 1,319.26).

### Indaiatuba Pats Picks Up Victory over Amparo Bikers to Grab 7th Place 

Indaiatuba Pats took down Amparo Bikers 117.96 to 105.32 led by Bucky Irving who got 27.10 points and DJ Moore who scored 26.90. Indaiatuba Pats took a 62.20-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to Amparo Bikers in their last meeting a season ago. Indaiatuba Pats (7-5, 1,303.98 points) climbs into seventh place and Amparo Bikers (5-7, 1,311.90 points) stays in 10th place.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left points out on the field. On the winning side, Jonathan Taylor got 11 touches but only tallied 35 total yards, while Javonte Williams was even less effective, managing just six yards on 10 touches for Amparo Bikers. One spot where Amparo Bikers is really kicking themselves is running back. Tony Pollard could have started in place of Javonte Williams, and that point difference would've ultimately changed the outcome.

 While Jalen Hurts led Indaiatuba Pats last week with 18.74 points, Irving paved the way this week with 27.10.

### Holambra Dutch Pounds Sorocaba Steelers to Grab 5th Place 

Holambra Dutch annihilated Sorocaba Steelers 146.72 to 89.70 while putting up the fifth-highest score of the season. This beatdown was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago. Sorocaba Steelers was led by A.J. Brown with 22.90 points (109 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and DeAndre Hopkins, who scored 14.50 (35 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Holambra Dutch (7-5, 1,391.84 points) climbs into fifth place and Sorocaba Steelers (6-6, 1,400.22 points) drops to eighth place.

 Joe Mixon and Austin Ekeler had plenty of chances for Sorocaba Steelers, but they logged just 69 total yards on 30 combined touches between them.

 In addition to the fantasy victory, Holambra Dutch was savvy enough to choose winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Jake Moody was the only one that didn't play on a winning NFL team in Week 12. Barkley has now led Holambra Dutch in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last four.

 Holambra Dutch goes up against Sorocaba Wild Mules (7-5, 1,306.50) in Week 13. Sorocaba Steelers gets top-ranked Paulinia Robots (8-4, 1,488.62).

Indaiatuba Blues picked up 19.00 points from the Houston Texans DEF (30 PA, 1 TD, 8 Sack, 1 Int, 2 Fum) and 16.12 from Will Levis (278 Pas Yds, 2 TD/1 Int). This close win was revenge for a loss to Rio Claro Farmers in their last meeting a season ago. Rio Claro Farmers was led by Terry McLaurin with 21.20 points (102 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Aaron Jones, who scored 19.90 (106 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). The gap could have been wider as Indaiatuba Blues had a starter score zero points (Diontae Johnson). Indaiatuba Blues (7-5, 1,315.54 points) climbs into sixth place and Rio Claro Farmers (7-5, 1,311.52 points) stays in second place.

 While Josh Allen led Indaiatuba Blues in Week 11 with 23.98 points, the Texans Defense paved the way this week with 19.00.

### Big Three Is More Than Enough, as Barao Butchers Punishes Limeira Dead Rabbits 

With the triumvirate of Courtland Sutton, Patrick Mahomes, and George Kittle leading the way, Barao Butchers overwhelmed Limeira Dead Rabbits 124.66 to 62.28. Combining for 78.66 points, that threesome alone eclipsed the total of Limeira Dead Rabbits. Sutton scored two touchdowns, accumulating 29.70 points (97 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Mahomes recorded three passing touchdowns to contribute 28.76 points (269 Pas Yds, 60 Rsh Yds, 3 TD), while Kittle helped out with 20.20 points (82 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Sutton also recorded his highest point total of the season, with Mahomes tallying his highest point total of the season. The 62.38-point win for Barao Butchers was the fifth-largest in the league this year. Adding insult to injury, Limeira Dead Rabbits had several starters score zero points. Barao Butchers (4-8, 1,319.26 points) climbs into 12th place, while Limeira Dead Rabbits (4-8, 1,149.40 points) sinks into the cellar.

 Since Sutton was the leading point-getter for Barao Butchers, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 24.80 points, George Kittle paced the squad in Week 8, while Patrick Mahomes put up 24.54 points to lead the way in Week 9. Calvin Ridley (25.40 points) was tops in Week 10 and Amon-Ra St. Brown (38.70 points) led in Week 11.

 Barao Butchers will face Indaiatuba Riders (4-8, 1,167.74) next week. Limeira Dead Rabbits squares off against Campinas Giants (5-7, 1,293.10).
