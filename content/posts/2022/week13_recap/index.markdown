### Sorocaba Wild Mules Picks Up Win Against Barao Butchers for 3rd Straight Win 

Sorocaba Wild Mules took advantage of 21.20 points from DeVonta Smith (102 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 18.00 from the San Francisco 49ers DEF (17 PA, 1 TD, 3 Sack, 3 Int, 1 Fum), taking down Barao Butchers 123.50 to 89.24. Sorocaba Wild Mules took a 5.20-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. This win had a taste of revenge for Sorocaba Wild Mules following a difficult postseason defeat last year to Barao Butchers. Adding insult to injury, Barao Butchers had a starter score zero points (Dawson Knox). Barao Butchers (5-8, 1,270.04 points) drops to 11th place and Sorocaba Wild Mules (4-9, 1,300.46 points) remains in 12th place.

 Since Smith was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Wild Mules, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 23.60 points, Dalvin Cook paced the squad in Week 10, while Dak Prescott (20.64 points) was tops in Week 11 and Samaje Perine (19.30 points) last week.

 In Week 14, Sorocaba Wild Mules goes up against Paulinia Robots (9-4, 1,594.92), who puts up a stout 122.69 points per game. Barao Butchers squares off against Amparo Bikers (6-7, 1,433.90).

Indaiatuba Riders was led by Davante Adams this week (177 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Adams racked up 177 yards and contributed 37.70 points to the final tally. Tony Pollard also pitched in with 24.60 points with two touchdowns (91 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). To make matters worse, Limeira Dead Rabbits had a starter score zero points (Mike Williams). The 146.00 points represented the highest overall total in the league this week.

### Amparo Bikers Clips Campinas Giants for 3rd in a Row 

Amparo Bikers got the second-highest score by a player this week from Amon-Ra St. Brown with 34.60 points (114 Rec Yds, 2 TD), stealing one from Campinas Giants 104.04 to 102.54. Amparo Bikers took a 36.96-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. This close call was revenge for a loss to Campinas Giants in their last meeting a season ago. Amparo Bikers (6-7, 1,433.90 points) remains in ninth place and Campinas Giants (2-11, 1,270.92 points) stays locked in last place.

### Goncalves Miners Beats Sorocaba Steelers, Makes It Four in a Row 

Goncalves Miners got the second-highest score this week, taking down Sorocaba Steelers 131.54 to 99.38. This win was revenge for a loss to Sorocaba Steelers in their last meeting a season ago. Sorocaba Steelers was led by Tyreek Hill with 29.60 points (146 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Chris Godwin, who scored 14.30 (63 Rec Yds). Sorocaba Steelers (8-5, 1,420.38 points) drops to sixth place and Goncalves Miners (11-2, 1,652.50 points) remains in first place.

 There was one important player on Goncalves Miners that let some chances slip away. Despite being targeted seven times, Zay Jones could only manage two catches.

 In addition to the fantasy victory, Goncalves Miners was savvy enough to pick winners in real football, as well. Among all of their starters, Zay Jones was the only one that didn't suit up on a winning NFL team this past week. Since Burrow was the top point-getter for Goncalves Miners, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 35.30 points, Justin Jefferson paced the squad in Week 10, while Amari Cooper (31.30 points) was tops in Week 11 and Josh Jacobs (48.30 points) in Week 12. Additionally, with 20 touches this week for Ezekiel Elliott, it means that his touches have now increased in four consecutive games.

 Goncalves Miners goes up against London Knights (7-6, 1,195.14) next week. Sorocaba Steelers squares off against Limeira Dead Rabbits (5-8, 1,267.14).

### Rio Claro Farmers Tops Indaiatuba Blues, Rises to 4th Place 

Indaiatuba Blues had trouble scoring points this week and fell to Rio Claro Farmers 81.04 to 74.62. Indaiatuba Blues has lost their fourth straight matchup. AJ Dillon led Indaiatuba Blues with 20.90 points (93 Rsh Yds, 26 Rec Yds, 1 TD) while Josh Allen brought in 16.92 (223 Pas Yds, 2 TD). If Indaiatuba Blues didn't have both Michael Carter and Cooper Kupp put up zeroes, things could have been different. Rio Claro Farmers (8-5, 1,379.40 points) climbs into fourth place and Indaiatuba Blues (2-11, 1,334.10 points) stays in 13th place.

 There was one notable player on Rio Claro Farmers that let some chances slip away. Even though Nico Collins saw a total of 10 targets, he only reeled in three catches.

 While Devin Singletary led Rio Claro Farmers in Week 11 (with 17.70 points) and Lamar Jackson last week (23.06 points), Barkley has now been the team's top point-getter twice in the past four weeks.

 In Week 14, Rio Claro Farmers matches up against Campinas Giants (2-11, 1,270.92), the last-place team in the league. Indaiatuba Blues plays Limeira Jetsons (8-5, 1,473.30).

### Limeira Jetsons Picks Up Victory over London Knights, Moves Up to 5th Place 

Limeira Jetsons picked up 22.20 points from Stefon Diggs (92 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 21.10 from D'Andre Swift (62 Rsh Yds, 49 Rec Yds, 1 TD), taking down London Knights 109.00 to 94.08. A late push on Sunday Night Football (25.70 SNF points, 27% of their total score) wasn't enough for London Knights. Limeira Jetsons took an 18.20-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to London Knights in their last meeting a season ago. The result might have been even worse as Limeira Jetsons had a starter score zero points (Zach Ertz). Limeira Jetsons (8-5, 1,473.30 points) climbs into fifth place and London Knights (7-6, 1,195.14 points) drops to seventh place.

 Kenneth Walker III really deserved more touches for Limeira Jetsons, as he put up a whopping 36 total yards on just three touches.

 While Jamaal Williams led Limeira Jetsons in Week 11 (with 24.40 points) and Justin Herbert in Week 12 (28.76 points), Diggs has now been the team's leading point-getter twice in the last four matches.

 Limeira Jetsons faces Indaiatuba Blues (2-11, 1,334.10) next week. London Knights gets first-place Goncalves Miners (11-2, 1,652.50).
