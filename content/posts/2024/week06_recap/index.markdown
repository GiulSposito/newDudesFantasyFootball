<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/teamPerf-1.png" width="672" />


## League Highlights

Holambra Dutch has now beaten their projected score five weeks in a row.

Sorocaba Steelers has now beaten their projected score four weeks in a row.

Sorocaba Wild Mules earned the win this week despite not starting a top-30 scoring WR.

Paulinia Robots continues defying the pundits, and has beaten their projected score four weeks in a row.

Indaiatuba Pats continues defying the pundits, and has beaten their projected score three weeks in a row.

Unfortunately, Campinas Giants fell short of their projected score for the fifth straight week.

As one might expect, teams have won 63.6% of the time this season when they throw no picks in a week.

So far this season, teams have won only 40.0% of the time when starting the league's top-scoring QB of the week (2-3 overall).

Limeira Jetsons is on a four-game winning streak.

London Knights is on a three-game winning streak.

Limeira Dead Rabbits probably wishes they had started Baker Mayfield. The 25.90 points he scored would have represented the fifth-highest individual score this week.

Free Agents Sean Tucker, Gabe Davis and Demario Douglas combined to score more points than all of Limeira Dead Rabbits's starters this week.

Rio Claro Farmers was favored by the widest margin in the league this week (27.83 points) and delivered with a 71.50-point victory.

The average projected score for Week 6 was 97.14 points.

## Matchups Recap

### London Knights Gets Victory Against Paulinia Robots, Bounces Them Out of 1st 

London Knights (fourth place, 4-2, 640.76 points) drops Paulinia Robots (4-2, 730.06 points) out of the top spot, beating them 112.10 to 103.32. Jared Goff (315 Pas Yds, 3 TD) led London Knights with 25.10 points while David Montgomery (80 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) scored 21.00. Paulinia Robots still cannot beat London Knights, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Even though these teams are tied for fourth place with matching 4-2 records, Paulinia Robots has a solid lead in points, 730.06 to 640.76.

 Based on their production, Jordan Mason and Emanuel Wilson really deserved to get the ball more, as they logged an impressive 155 total yards between them on just 18 combined touches for Paulinia Robots.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, London Knights was savvy enough to choose winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, CeeDee Lamb was the only one whose NFL team lost in Week 6. Since Goff was the top point-getter for London Knights, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 21.20 points, David Montgomery paced the squad in Week 3, while CeeDee Lamb (23.60 points) was tops in Week 4 and Mike Evans (23.20 points) in Week 5. Also, with 14 targets this week for the Dallas WR, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 London Knights matches up against Rio Claro Farmers (4-2, 682.92) in Week 7. Paulinia Robots plays Holambra Dutch (3-3, 708.02), who has averaged a stout 118.00 points this season.

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Snatches One from Indaiatuba Pats to Capture 10th Place 

Sorocaba Wild Mules picked up 25.50 points from Bijan Robinson (95 Rsh Yds, 2 TD) and 18.20 from J.K. Dobbins (96 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) to defeat Indaiatuba Pats 105.56 to 99.74. Sorocaba Wild Mules came into the Monday night game facing a 9.08-point deficit, but scored 14.90 for the comeback victory. This matchup saw four lead changes, with the largest lead being 53.28 points after Sunday afternoon. This win was a bit of revenge for Sorocaba Wild Mules following a heartbreaking postseason loss last year to Indaiatuba Pats. If Indaiatuba Pats didn't have both Marvin Harrison Jr. and Jake Moody put up zeroes, the outcome might have been different. Sorocaba Wild Mules (3-3, 610.04 points) climbs into 10th place and Indaiatuba Pats (2-4, 646.20 points) drops to 11th place.

 There was one starter on Indaiatuba Pats that let some chances slip through his hands. Despite being targeted 11 times, Wan'Dale Robinson could manage just five catches. There are a few spots where Indaiatuba Pats wishes they could get a do-over, as Keenan Allen could have started in place of Marvin Harrison Jr., DJ Moore, or Wan'Dale Robinson. Any of those point differentials would've changed the outcome.

 Since Robinson was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Wild Mules, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 19.20 points, Khalil Shakir paced the squad in Week 3, while Christian Kirk (19.10 points) was tops in Week 4 and Kyler Murray (24.10 points) last week.

### With Their Stars Coming Up Big, Sorocaba Steelers Squashes Indaiatuba Riders 

The three-headed monster of Chris Godwin, Joe Mixon, and Justin Fields led the way, as Sorocaba Steelers dismantled Indaiatuba Riders 159.30 to 91.90. That threesome combined to tally 86.40 points, winning the battle against the top scorers from Indaiatuba Riders (Brock Purdy, Alvin Kamara, and Tee Higgins), who totaled 56.20 points. Godwin scored two touchdowns, accumulating 35.50 points (125 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Meanwhile, Mixon came through with two touchdowns (27.20 points) and Fields scored two touchdowns (23.70 points). Godwin also recorded the highest point total in the league this week, with Mixon tallying his highest point total of the season. Sorocaba Steelers had the highest score in the league this year, as well as the second-biggest margin of victory. Sorocaba Steelers (3-3, 702.28 points) climbs into eighth place, while Indaiatuba Riders (0-6, 557.86 points) stays locked in last place.

 Since Godwin was the top point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has led the team in each of the last four weeks. With 20.70 points, Zack Moss paced the squad in Week 3, while Justin Fields (31.98 points) was tops in Week 4 and Brock Bowers (23.70 points) last week. To go along with the fantasy victory, Sorocaba Steelers was savvy enough to select winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, Brock Bowers was the only one whose NFL team lost in Week 6.

 Sorocaba Steelers will face first-place Limeira Jetsons (5-1, 689.86) next week. Indaiatuba Riders takes on Indaiatuba Pats (2-4, 646.20).

### Indaiatuba Blues Beats Amparo Bikers to Grab 3rd Place 

Amparo Bikers had trouble scoring points this week and lost to Indaiatuba Blues 109.40 to 78.12. This win was a bit of revenge for Indaiatuba Blues following a tough postseason defeat last year to Amparo Bikers. Deebo Samuel Sr. led Amparo Bikers with 20.70 points (102 Rec Yds, 1 TD) while Tony Pollard racked up 17.80 (93 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). With Indaiatuba Blues receiving goose eggs from two of their starters, the result might have been even worse. Indaiatuba Blues (4-2, 687.10 points) climbs into third place and Amparo Bikers (4-2, 641.78 points) drops to sixth place.

 Amparo Bikers had one significant player that let some chances slip through his hands. Despite being targeted seven times, Rashid Shaheed could only reel in one catch.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Indaiatuba Blues was savvy enough to select winners in real football, as well. Among all of their starters, Diontae Johnson was the only one that didn't suit up on a winning NFL team in Week 6. While James Cook led Indaiatuba Blues weeks (with 17.90 points), Henry has now been the team's top scorer in two of the last three matches.

 Next week, Indaiatuba Blues will face Amparo Bikers (4-2, 641.78). Amparo Bikers takes on Indaiatuba Blues (4-2, 687.10).

### Rio Claro Farmers Blasts Limeira Dead Rabbits, Grabs 5th Place 

The two-headed monster of Garrett Wilson and Cole Kmet carried the team, as Rio Claro Farmers overwhelmed Limeira Dead Rabbits 141.08 to 69.58. That tandem teamed up to score 48.70 points, topping the production from Breece Hall and C.J. Stroud (40.28 combined points), the top two on Limeira Dead Rabbits. Kmet scored two touchdowns, adding 24.00 points (70 Rec Yds, 2 TD). For the winners, Wilson also pitched in 24.70 points (107 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Rio Claro Farmers took a 12.48-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Limeira Dead Rabbits just doesn't have what it takes to beat Rio Claro Farmers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Kmet (acquired via free agency in Week 3) made a big impact, posting 24.00 points. To make matters worse, Limeira Dead Rabbits had several starters score zero points. Rio Claro Farmers (4-2, 682.92 points) climbs into fifth place and Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-3, 654.68 points) drops to ninth place.

 Unfortunately for Limeira Dead Rabbits, Chris Olave was the lone WR to post a negative score (one of only two total starters in the league to do so ).

 With Wilson leading the way in Week 6, it means Rio Claro Farmers continues to have a different top scorer every week this season.

### Limeira Jetsons Tops Campinas Giants, Takes Top Spot in League 

After beating Campinas Giants (12th place, 2-4, 593.92 points) 107.86 to 76.02, Limeira Jetsons (5-1, 689.86 points) claims the top spot in the league. Campinas Giants struggled to put points on the board, ranking 13th in points this week. Limeira Jetsons took a 4.50-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Limeira Jetsons has now won four in a row. Campinas Giants actually averages more per game in losses (102.70) than wins (91.55).

 Sadly for Campinas Giants, Travis Etienne was the lone running back to earn a negative score (one of only two starters league-wide in the red ). Additionally, they had a player that left points out on the field. Despite being targeted eight times, George Pickens could manage just three catches.

 While Justin Jefferson led Limeira Jetsons in Week 2 (with 23.30 points) and Darnell Mooney matches (31.50 points), Daniels has now been the team's leading point-getter in four of the last six weeks.

He passed for four touchdowns as part of his huge game (258 Pas Yds, 4 TD/1 Int).

 There was one fairly noticeable player on Holambra Dutch that missed out on some chances. Despite being targeted 11 times, DK Metcalf could only manage three catches.
