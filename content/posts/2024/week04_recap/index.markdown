## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Picks Up Win Against Indaiatuba Blues, Moves Up to 3rd Place 

A rally on Sunday Night Football (49.00 points, 41% of their total score) wasn't enough for Indaiatuba Blues, as Paulinia Robots got the 139.44 to 118.50 victory. Paulinia Robots was led by Nico Collins (151 Rec Yds, 1 TD). Collins racked up 151 yards and provided 33.10 points to the cause. Paulinia Robots (3-1, 482.32 points) climbs into third place, while Indaiatuba Blues (2-2, 477.56 points) drops to seventh place.

 With 27 touches this week for Derrick Henry, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 5, Paulinia Robots goes up against Sorocaba Steelers (2-2, 429.54). Indaiatuba Blues takes on Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-1, 505.96), who has averaged a league-leading 126.49 points this season.

### Rio Claro Farmers Tops Sorocaba Wild Mules to Capture 5th Place 

Sorocaba Wild Mules could not get off the starting blocks this week and lost to Rio Claro Farmers 98.50 to 66.88. Rio Claro Farmers took a 4.80-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Sorocaba Wild Mules just doesn't have what it takes to beat Rio Claro Farmers, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. To make matters worse, Sorocaba Wild Mules had a starter score zero points (Trey McBride). Rio Claro Farmers (3-1, 421.18 points) climbs into fifth place and Sorocaba Wild Mules (2-2, 388.68 points) drops to 10th place.

 Unfortunately for Sorocaba Wild Mules, the Bills Defense was the lone defense to earn a negative score (one of only two starters league-wide in negative territory ). Devin Singletary had plenty of chances for Rio Claro Farmers, but posted just 38 total yards on 15 touches.

### Limeira Dead Rabbits Gets Win over Amparo Bikers, Ushers Them from 1st Place 

Limeira Dead Rabbits (second place, 3-1, 505.96 points) pushes Amparo Bikers (3-1, 437.88 points) out of the league's top spot after beating them 140.40 to 103.24. They registered the second-highest point total this week. Limeira Dead Rabbits took a 6.36-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. Amparo Bikers still cannot beat Limeira Dead Rabbits, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. These two teams are tied for second place with 3-1 records, but Limeira Dead Rabbits has a clear lead in points, 505.96 to 437.88. To make matters worse, Amparo Bikers received no points from Mark Andrews.

 Breece Hall had plenty of chances for Limeira Dead Rabbits, but he logged just 18 total yards on 12 touches.

 In Week 5, Limeira Dead Rabbits takes on Indaiatuba Blues (2-2, 477.56), while Amparo Bikers battles Rio Claro Farmers (3-1, 421.18).

### Limeira Jetsons Comes Back to Edge Sorocaba Steelers, Takes Top Spot in League 

Limeira Jetsons (3-1, 460.98 points) edged Sorocaba Steelers (2-2, 429.54 points) 94.22 to 94.08. They were led by Jayden Daniels (233 Pas Yds, 47 Rsh Yds, 1 2PT, 1 Pas TD/1 Int, 1 Rsh TD) with 24.02 points and Justin Jefferson (85 Rec Yds, 1 TD), who scored 20.50. Limeira Jetsons was first to put points on the board and went into Sunday with a 10.00 to 0.00 lead. That advantage slipped away after the early Sunday games and they trailed by 45.48. However, Limeira Jetsons rallied to victory on Monday night, with the aid of 19.80 points from Jahmyr Gibbs during the Lions/Seahawks game.

 Zach Charbonnet ultimately deserved more touches for Limeira Jetsons, as he put up a whopping 54 total yards on just seven touches.

 With 19 touches this week for Zack Moss, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 5, Limeira Jetsons will face London Knights (2-2, 419.86). Sorocaba Steelers gets Paulinia Robots (3-1, 482.32), who is averaging a stout 120.58 points per game.

### London Knights Wins Against Holambra Dutch, Grabs 8th Place 

A primetime rally on Monday Night Football (49.00 points, 38% of their total score) wasn't enough for Holambra Dutch, as London Knights earned the 144.44 to 130.56 victory. The late-match efforts were impressive, considering their pregame projections only called for 23.57 points on Monday night. London Knights was led by CeeDee Lamb, who contributed 23.60 points to the cause (98 Rec Yds, 1 TD). The 144.44 points represented the top overall total in the league this week. London Knights (2-2, 419.86 points) climbs into eighth place, while Holambra Dutch (1-3, 447.04 points) steps into 11th place.

 A spot where Holambra Dutch really made a regrettable decision is WR. Jordan Addison could have started in place of Zay Flowers, and that point difference would've swayed the outcome.

 In addition to the fantasy W, London Knights was savvy enough to select winners in real life, as well. Among all of their starters, Pat Freiermuth was the only one whose NFL team lost in Week 4.

 Next week, London Knights plays Limeira Jetsons (3-1, 460.98), while Holambra Dutch goes up against Indaiatuba Riders (0-4, 370.70).

### Campinas Giants Gets Win over Barao Butchers, Moves Up to 9th Place 

Campinas Giants got 16.30 points from George Pickens (113 Rec Yds) and 16.28 from Joe Burrow (232 Pas Yds, 2 TD/1 Int) to take down Barao Butchers 95.08 to 87.08. Campinas Giants took an 11.90-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Barao Butchers still cannot beat Campinas Giants, who extended their career unbeaten streak to two games in the series. Barao Butchers got zero points from Rashee Rice, which might have made the difference in the outcome. Campinas Giants (2-2, 413.02 points) climbs into ninth place and Barao Butchers (1-3, 414.24 points) drops to 13th place.

 Sadly for Barao Butchers, Carson Steele was the lone running back to post a negative score (one of only two starters league-wide in the red ). De'Von Achane had lots of looks for Campinas Giants, but only managed 29 total yards on 13 touches.
