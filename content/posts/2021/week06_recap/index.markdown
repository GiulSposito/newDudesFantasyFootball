## Matchups Recap

### Led by a Big Game from Jonathan Taylor, London Knights Gets Victory over Paulinia Robots 

With the output from Jonathan Taylor playing an integral role, London Knights got a victory over Paulinia Robots 138.14 to 116.46. Taylor heated up for 28.80 points in a 21.68-point win for London Knights. He scored two touchdowns as part of his huge game (145 Rsh Yds, 2 TD). The gap could have been wider as London Knights had a starter score zero points (Nick Chubb). London Knights (2-4, 768.22 points) climbs into 11th place, while Paulinia Robots (4-2, 798.36 points) stays in second place.

 Paulinia Robots had one player that let some chances slip through his hands. Even though Tyler Lockett saw a total of seven targets, he only reeled in two catches.

 While Mark Andrews led London Knights matches (with 41.70 points), Taylor has now been the team's high scorer in two of the past three weeks.
