Sorocaba Wild Mules took an 18.00-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. This win was revenge for a loss to Campinas Giants in their last meeting a season ago.

 Tracy had plenty of opportunities for Holambra Dutch, but could only manage 36 total yards on 11 touches.

 It wasn't all bad news for Holambra Dutch, as they did put together a team of real-life winners. Every starter except Tyrone Tracy Jr. played on an NFL team that won this past week.

### London Knights Beats Rio Claro Farmers to Capture 10th Place 

In a shootout between this week's first and third-highest-scoring teams, London Knights defeated Rio Claro Farmers 140.96 to 131.40. This is the most a team has scored this season without getting a victory. The loss drops Rio Claro Farmers to 8-5, but they maintain their fourth-place position in the standings. Rio Claro Farmers still clinched it's spot in the postseason this week. The scoring output from London Knights was unexpected given that they were only expected to score 99.75 points. Rio Claro Farmers scored 124.7% of their projected 105.34. A.J. Brown (132 Rec Yds, 2 TD) amassed the highest score this week (35.20) and Jameson Williams scored 26.90 points to lead London Knights. Bijan Robinson (142 Rsh Yds, 51 Rec Yds, 1 TD) put up the second-highest point total of the week (30.30) and Terry McLaurin scored 22.60 points for Rio Claro Farmers.

 Breaking down the outcome, Rio Claro Farmers can point the finger at their WR, Michael Pittman. Pittman was projected to score 12.17 points, actually produced 2.30, and that difference was enough for London Knights to take the win.

 London Knights was on another level with their wideouts, as they started two of the league's top-10 overall WRs this week (including Brown, who was best overall). Brown has now led London Knights in scoring in back-to-back weeks.

 London Knights takes on Limeira Jetsons (7-6, 1,359.50) in Week 14, while Rio Claro Farmers gets Indaiatuba Blues (6-7, 1,296.64).

### Indaiatuba Pats Gets Win over Limeira Dead Rabbits for 6th Straight Win 

The combo of Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers led the charge, as Indaiatuba Pats defeated Limeira Dead Rabbits 125.34 to 101.84.
