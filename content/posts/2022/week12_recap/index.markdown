## Matchups Recap

### Barao Butchers Wins Against Paulinia Robots, Expels Them from 1st Place 

Barao Butchers (5-7, 1,180.80 points) defeated Paulinia Robots (9-3, 1,492.20 points) 118.64 to 91.60 led by James Conner (120 Rsh Yds, 1 Rec TD) with 21.00 points and DK Metcalf (90 Rec Yds), who scored 20.00.
