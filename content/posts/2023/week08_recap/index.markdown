### Amparo Bikers Pulls Off Comeback over Indaiatuba Pats 

Down 9.70 on Monday night, Amparo Bikers came back, taking down Indaiatuba Pats 110.08 to 101.98. Amparo Bikers picked up 25.10 points from Jaylen Waddle (121 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 19.70 from Sam LaPorta (57 Rec Yds, 1 TD). This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands four times, with the largest lead being 26.20 points after Thursday. Amparo Bikers beat their projections and put up 16.3% more points than projected (94.68). Indaiatuba Pats got just 86.3% of a projected 118.14 points.

 There was one player on Indaiatuba Pats that missed out on some opportunities. Even though Puka Nacua saw a total of seven targets, he reeled in just three catches. A position where Indaiatuba Pats really made a regrettable choice is WR. CeeDee Lamb could have started in place of Puka Nacua, and that point difference would have been enough to earn the win.
