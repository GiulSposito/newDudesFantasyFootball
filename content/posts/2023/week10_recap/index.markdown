## Matchups Recap

### Campinas Giants Snatches One from Paulinia Robots, Extends Their Losing Streak 

Campinas Giants picked up 28.42 points from Justin Herbert (323 Pas Yds, 4 TD/1 Int) and 18.50 from Alvin Kamara (42 Rsh Yds, 33 Rec Yds, 2 2PT), taking down Paulinia Robots 115.62 to 110.90. Campinas Giants came into the Sunday night game facing a 2.88-point deficit, but scored 18.30 for the comeback victory. After dropping their last five matchups, Paulinia Robots has fallen apart. Paulinia Robots was led by Mike Evans with 26.30 points (143 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Kenneth Walker III, who scored 19.70 (63 Rsh Yds, 64 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD). Both teams left points off the scoreboard as Campinas Giants had one starter turn in zero points and Paulinia Robots also had one. Paulinia Robots (4-6, 1,113.48 points) drops to ninth place and Campinas Giants (8-2, 1,162.10 points) remains in first place.

 Paulinia Robots had one glaring starter that missed out on some opportunities. Despite being targeted seven times, Christian Watson could only manage two catches.

 Considering Cade Otton could only manage 3.00 points, Campinas Giants was extremely fortunate that Paulinia Robots's top TE had his bye week. If Travis Kelce (17.59 points per game this year) was in the lineup and produced his average, Campinas Giants would have been beaten by 9.87 points. It wasn't all bad news for Paulinia Robots, as they did field a squad of real-life winners. Every starter except Christian Watson played for an NFL team that won this week. While the Ravens Defense led Campinas Giants with 15.00 points in Week 9, Herbert paced the squad this week with 28.42. Also, with 29 touches this week for Josh Jacobs, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 11, Campinas Giants takes on Barao Butchers (6-4, 1,046.32), while Paulinia Robots faces Limeira Dead Rabbits (3-7, 1,008.90).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Overwhelms London Knights for 3rd Straight Win 

Sorocaba Wild Mules got the second-highest point total this week, leveling London Knights 135.96 to 75.10. Sorocaba Wild Mules has some momentum after winning their third straight. London Knights was led by Ja'Marr Chase with 23.40 points (124 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Zay Flowers, who scored 12.30 (73 Rec Yds). Adding insult to injury, London Knights had two starters score zero points (the Washington Commanders DEF and Jimmy Garoppolo). Sorocaba Wild Mules (6-4, 1,175.00 points) climbs into fifth place and London Knights (6-4, 1,133.88 points) drops to sixth place.

 AJ Dillon ultimately deserved more touches for London Knights, as he put up a whopping 81 total yards on just 10 touches.

 Prescott has now led Sorocaba Wild Mules in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last five.

 Sorocaba Wild Mules gets Indaiatuba Blues (3-7, 979.44) in Week 11, while London Knights goes up against Amparo Bikers (4-6, 998.24).

### Indaiatuba Riders Gets Win Against Rio Claro Farmers to Capture 8th Place 

Indaiatuba Riders got 20.60 points from George Kittle (116 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 17.60 from David Montgomery (116 Rsh Yds, 1 TD) to beat Rio Claro Farmers 116.26 to 102.72. This was a back-and-forth battle that saw the lead change hands three times, with the largest lead being 39.40 points after Thursday. Even though both teams hit their projections, Indaiatuba Riders put up 18.1% more than their projected 98.44 points to secure the win. Indaiatuba Riders (5-5, 1,087.94 points) climbs into eighth place and Rio Claro Farmers (6-4, 1,133.36 points) stays in fourth place.

 One slot where Rio Claro Farmers is really kicking themselves is tight end. Trey McBride could have started in place of Jonnu Smith, and that point difference would've ultimately changed the outcome.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, Indaiatuba Riders was savvy enough to pick winners in real football, as well. Among all of their starters, Adam Thielen was the only one that played on a losing NFL team this past week. The leading scorer for Indaiatuba Riders has flip-flopped the last few weeks. Patrick Mahomes led the team with 33.86 points in Week 7 and 15.80 points matches, while Kittle led the way in Week 8 (with 23.90 points) and then again this week.

 Indaiatuba Riders will face Limeira Jetsons (7-3, 1,132.62) next week. Rio Claro Farmers gets last-place Sorocaba Steelers (2-8, 1,026.38).

### Sorocaba Steelers Gets Victory over Amparo Bikers, Drops Them into 10th Place 

Amparo Bikers found it difficult to score this week and fell to Sorocaba Steelers 90.36 to 73.92. Sorocaba Steelers took a 9.60-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. Both sides failed to meet expectations, but Sorocaba Steelers scored 87.4% of a projected 103.37 points to pick up the win. Amparo Bikers (4-6, 998.24 points) drops to 10th place and Sorocaba Steelers (2-8, 1,026.38 points) remains mired in last place.

 Unfortunately for Amparo Bikers, the Lions Defense wasn't just the lone D to tally a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in the red. There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities. On the winning side, Gus Edwards got 12 touches but only tallied 28 total yards, while Derrick Henry managed just 24 yards on 12 touches for Amparo Bikers.

 Since Murray was the leading point-getter for Sorocaba Steelers, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 15.80 points, Isiah Pacheco paced the squad in Week 6, while Jerome Ford put up 17.40 points to lead the way in Week 7. DeAndre Hopkins (34.80 points) was tops in Week 8 and C.J. Stroud (41.80 points) led in Week 9.

 In Week 11, Sorocaba Steelers plays Rio Claro Farmers (6-4, 1,133.36), while Amparo Bikers gets London Knights (6-4, 1,133.88).
