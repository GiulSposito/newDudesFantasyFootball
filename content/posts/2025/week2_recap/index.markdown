## Matchups Recap

### Paulinia Robots Gets Victory Against Indaiatuba Riders 

A primetime comeback on Monday Night Football (33.30 points, 36% of their total score) wasn't enough for Indaiatuba Riders, as Paulinia Robots earned the 129.82 to 93.00 victory. The late-match efforts were a bit unexpected, considering their original Monday projection was only 25.66 points. Paulinia Robots was led by Jahmyr Gibbs, who contributed 19.40 points to the total (94 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). On top of the loss, Indaiatuba Riders had a starter score zero points (the Denver Broncos DEF). Indaiatuba Riders (1-1, 202.12 points) winds up in 10th place, while Paulinia Robots (2-0, 247.88 points) remains in third place.

 There was one player on Indaiatuba Riders who wasn't fully in tune with his QB. Despite being targeted 12 times, Brian Thomas Jr. could manage just four catches.

 Paulinia Robots gets Amparo Bikers (0-2, 220.68) in Week 3, while Indaiatuba Riders battles Sorocaba Steelers (2-0, 213.26).

### Sorocaba Wild Mules Ekes Out Win Against Amparo Bikers 

Sorocaba Wild Mules got 26.20 points from De'Von Achane (30 Rsh Yds, 92 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD) and 22.84 from Daniel Jones (316 Pas Yds, 1 Pas TD, 1 Rsh TD) to edge Amparo Bikers 118.04 to 114.40. Sorocaba Wild Mules took an 11.50-point lead on Sunday afternoon and never looked back. This close win was revenge for a loss to Amparo Bikers in their last meeting a season ago. Amparo Bikers would probably like more output from fifth-round draft pick Evan Engram, who has scored 5.10 points and 2.20 points the past two weeks. Sorocaba Wild Mules (1-1, 200.48 points) shifts into 11th place and Amparo Bikers (0-2, 220.68 points) winds up in 12th place.

 There was one starter on Amparo Bikers that let some chances slip away. Even though Nico Collins saw a total of nine targets, he reeled in just three catches.

 Sorocaba Wild Mules squares off against Rio Claro Farmers (1-1, 206.62) next week, while Amparo Bikers matches up with Paulinia Robots (2-0, 247.88).

### Sorocaba Steelers Brings Down BroncosLoucura 

Lamar Jackson passed for four touchdowns (26.30 points) and CeeDee Lamb added 20.20 points as Sorocaba Steelers beat BroncosLoucura 107.20 to 86.50. While each team failed to meet expectations, Sorocaba Steelers scored 96.2% of their projected 111.42 points to get the win. BroncosLoucura was led by Jayden Daniels with 19.70 points (200 Pas Yds, 1 2PT, 2 TD) and Saquon Barkley, who scored 17.40 (88 Rsh Yds, 1 TD). Sorocaba Steelers (2-0, 213.26 points) shifts into fourth place and BroncosLoucura (0-2, 193.32 points) winds up in 14th place.

 Zach Charbonnet had plenty of opportunities for BroncosLoucura, but could only manage 10 total yards on 15 touches.

 Next week, Sorocaba Steelers gets Indaiatuba Riders (1-1, 202.12), while BroncosLoucura faces London Knights (1-1, 209.20).

### Indaiatuba Pats Slaps Rio Claro Farmers, Captures Career Series Lead 3-2 

Indaiatuba Pats picked up 33.96 points from Jared Goff (334 Pas Yds, 5 TD) and 22.70 from Christian McCaffrey (55 Rsh Yds, 52 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD), leveling Rio Claro Farmers 140.16 to 81.34. Indaiatuba Pats took a 27.40-point lead on Thursday and remained in front for the rest of the matchup. This beating was revenge for a loss to Rio Claro Farmers in their last meeting a season ago. Fifth-round draft pick Mark Andrews has been a disappointment thus far for Rio Claro Farmers, having put up 1.50 points and 1.40 points so far. Indaiatuba Pats (2-0, 249.46 points) shifts into second place and Rio Claro Farmers (1-1, 206.62 points) goes to sixth place.

 Ekeler had plenty of opportunities for Rio Claro Farmers, but could only manage 24 total yards on 10 touches.

 Indaiatuba Pats plays Limeira Jetsons (0-2, 196.90) next week, while Rio Claro Farmers goes up against Sorocaba Wild Mules (1-1, 200.48).

### London Knights Throat-Punches Barao Butchers, Still Undefeated All-Time Versus Them 

London Knights picked up 20.88 points from Jordan Love (292 Pas Yds, 2 TD) and 18.80 from Jameson Williams (108 Rec Yds, 1 TD), thumping Barao Butchers 106.18 to 60.90. London Knights took a 20.88-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Barao Butchers just cannot match up against London Knights, who extended their career unbeaten streak to four games in the series. London Knights (1-1, 209.20 points) moves into ninth place and Barao Butchers (0-2, 145.82 points) goes to the cellar.

 Isiah Pacheco and Derrick Henry had plenty of chances for Barao Butchers, but they logged just 52 total yards on 22 combined touches between them.

 To go along with the fantasy victory, London Knights was savvy enough to pick winners in real-life football, as well. Among all of their starters, Chris Boswell was the only one whose NFL team lost this past week.

 London Knights gets BroncosLoucura (0-2, 193.32) in Week 3, while Barao Butchers battles Indaiatuba Blues (2-0, 171.58).

### Behind Three Big Performances, Limeira Dead Rabbits Smashes Limeira Jetsons 

With the three-headed monster of Amon-Ra St. Brown, Rome Odunze, and Jonathan Taylor leading the way, Limeira Dead Rabbits overpowered Limeira Jetsons 152.58 to 90.58. That threesome combined to register 100.50 points, beating the total of Limeira Jetsons. Brown scored three touchdowns, accumulating 39.20 points (115 Rec Yds, 3 TD). Meanwhile, Odunze put up two touchdowns (31.80 points) and Taylor rushed for 165 yards (29.50 points). Also, Brown recorded the highest point total in the league this week. Limeira Dead Rabbits (1-1, 255.60 points) shifts into eighth place, while Limeira Jetsons (0-2, 196.90 points) winds up in 13th place.

 TreVeyon Henderson probably deserved more touches for Limeira Dead Rabbits, as he put up a whopping 40 total yards on just five touches.

 Limeira Dead Rabbits was ahead of the curve with their wideouts, as they started two of the league's top-five overall WRs this week (including St. Brown, who was best overall).

 In Week 3, Limeira Dead Rabbits plays Holambra Dutch (0-2, 164.06), while Limeira Jetsons goes up against Indaiatuba Pats (2-0, 249.46).

Indaiatuba Blues took an 11.80-point lead on Thursday and never looked back. This was a matchup that could have gone either way, with the 3.30-point margin being the fourth-smallest recorded in the league this season. Indaiatuba Blues (2-0, 171.58 points) moves into fifth place and Niners BH (1-1, 202.70 points) goes to seventh place.

 There were a few players in this matchup that had plenty of chances but didn't capitalize on opportunities.

### Campinas Giants Picks Apart Holambra Dutch, Takes Control of Career Series, 2-1 

Campinas Giants got the highest score this season, trashing Holambra Dutch 160.80 to 93.94. Campinas Giants took a 20.60-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup.

Campinas Giants (2-0, 279.68 points) moves into first place and Holambra Dutch (0-2, 164.06 points) winds up in 15th place.

 Unfortunately for Holambra Dutch, the Bears Defense wasn't just the lone D to post a negative score; they represented the only fantasy starter throughout the whole league in negative territory.

 Next week, Campinas Giants gets Niners BH (1-1, 202.70), while Holambra Dutch faces Limeira Dead Rabbits (1-1, 255.60).
