### Sorocaba Wild Mules Gets Late Rally on Sorocaba Steelers, Streak Now at Six 

Sorocaba Wild Mules (7-3, 1,129.32 points) benefited from the fourth-highest player score for the season from De'Von Achane (174 Rsh Yds, 51 Rec Yds, 2 TD), defeating Sorocaba Steelers (3-7, 961.34 points) 111.00 to 100.94 in a back-and-forth matchup. Sorocaba Wild Mules took the early lead, up 88.30 to 77.44 after the first set of Sunday games. The Miami RB played a significant part in the quick start with a big game. After the late Sunday games, they lost that lead and fell behind 100.94 to 90.30. However, Sorocaba Wild Mules took the lead for good during the Steelers/Chargers game on Sunday night.

 Along with being the one DEF to earn a negative score, the San Francisco 49ers DEF (on Sorocaba Steelers) represented the only starter in the whole league to do so. Additionally, Sorocaba Wild Mules had a glaring player that missed out on opportunities. Darnell Mooney could only reel in a single catch, despite seeing a total of eight targets.

 Achane has now led Sorocaba Wild Mules in scoring in back-to-back weeks.

### Amparo Bikers Tramples Indaiatuba Riders, Captures Career Series Lead 3-1 

Amparo Bikers took advantage of 24.40 points from Drake London (104 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and 22.92 from Baker Mayfield (273 Pas Yds, 3 TD), demolishing Indaiatuba Riders 119.42 to 62.66. This win had a taste of revenge for Amparo Bikers following a heartbreaking postseason loss last year to Indaiatuba Riders. Chris Olave led Indaiatuba Riders with 21.40 points (104 Rec Yds, 1 TD) while the Denver Broncos DEF brought in 12.00 (7 PA, 6 Sack, 1 Int). Amparo Bikers (4-6, 1,187.02 points) remains in 11th place and Indaiatuba Riders (1-9, 883.54 points) stays in 14th place.

 Each squad had a player that probably deserved to see more touches than he actually did. On the winning side, Ty Johnson got just three touches but was able to log 26 total yards, while Nick Chubb put up 52 yards on only six touches for Indaiatuba Riders.

 London has now led Amparo Bikers in scoring in back-to-back weeks, and for three of the last five. Also, even though he failed to catch eight of the targets that came his way, the fact that Nico Collins got 15 looks means that his targets have now risen in three straight games.

 Amparo Bikers gets Sorocaba Steelers (3-7, 961.34) next week, while Indaiatuba Riders matches up against Rio Claro Farmers (7-3, 1,086.24).

### BroncosLoucura Throat-Punches Rio Claro Farmers, Moves Up to 8th Place 

BroncosLoucura (5-5, 1,129.04 points) pummeled Rio Claro Farmers (7-3, 1,086.24 points) 136.02 to 68.82. They were led by Trey McBride (127 Rec Yds, 1 TD) with 27.70 points as well as the Seattle Seahawks DEF (22 PA, 2 TD, 5 Sack, 2 Fum), who had 21.00. BroncosLoucura struck first and by Sunday was already ahead 5.40 to 0.00. That advantage slipped away after the early Sunday games and they trailed by 8.90. However, following the late Sunday games, BroncosLoucura regained the lead for good.

 There was one glaring starter on BroncosLoucura that missed out on some chances. Despite being targeted 11 times, Jordan Addison could only manage three catches.

 While Saquon Barkley led BroncosLoucura in Week 8 (with 33.40 points) and Rico Dowdle in Week 9 (28.10 points), McBride has now been the team's leading point-getter twice in the past four matches.

### Indaiatuba Pats Waxes London Knights, Streak Now at Three 

Indaiatuba Pats put up the second-highest score of the week to annihilate London Knights 144.40 to 91.44. Indaiatuba Pats took a 1.80-point lead on Sunday afternoon and held the lead throughout the matchup. London Knights just cannot match up against Indaiatuba Pats, who extended their career unbeaten streak to three games in the series. Juwan Johnson (acquired via free agency in Week 1) has been a key addition for Indaiatuba Pats, ranking 18th among tight ends over the last four weeks. On top of the loss, London Knights received no points from Roschon Johnson. London Knights (5-5, 999.48 points) drops to 10th place and Indaiatuba Pats (9-1, 1,230.12 points) remains in second place.

 Croskey-Merritt had plenty of opportunities for London Knights, but could only manage 30 total yards on 11 touches.

 While Christian McCaffrey led Indaiatuba Pats last week with 34.30 points, Goff paved the way this week with 24.80. Also, with 26 touches this week for Josh Jacobs, it means that his touches have now increased in three consecutive games.

 Next week, Indaiatuba Pats squares off against Indaiatuba Blues (6-4, 1,057.34), while London Knights gets Sorocaba Wild Mules (7-3, 1,129.32).

### Limeira Jetsons Beats Barao Butchers for 3rd in a Row 

Kyren Williams scored two touchdowns (22.40 points) and Puka Nacua added 17.40 points as Limeira Jetsons got past Barao Butchers 90.72 to 78.40. This win was revenge for a loss to Barao Butchers in their last meeting a season ago. Barao Butchers was led by Stefon Diggs with 15.60 points (46 Rec Yds, 1 TD) and Cameron Dicker, who scored 13.00. Limeira Jetsons (5-5, 1,045.80 points) climbs into ninth place and Barao Butchers (1-9, 866.44 points) stays in 15th place.

 Both teams had a fairly noticeable starter that missed out on some chances. For Limeira Jetsons, Marvin Harrison Jr. saw a total of 12 targets, but was only able to reel in three catches. Calvin Austin III put on a similar showing for Barao Butchers, as he was only able to snag two passes on seven targets.

 Since Williams was the leading point-getter for Limeira Jetsons, it means a different player has now topped the team in each of the past five weeks. With 17.90 points, Tetairoa McMillan paced the squad in Week 6, while Trevor Lawrence put up 17.64 points to lead the way in Week 7. Troy Franklin (26.90 points) was tops in Week 8 and Puka Nacua (22.80 points) led in Week 9.

 Limeira Jetsons faces BroncosLoucura (5-5, 1,129.04) in Week 11. Barao Butchers takes on Holambra Dutch (0-10, 773.48), who sits in last place.

### Led by a Big Game from Jonathan Taylor, Limeira Dead Rabbits Beats Indaiatuba Blues 

The output from Jonathan Taylor made the difference, as Limeira Dead Rabbits defeated Indaiatuba Blues 119.90 to 100.60. Taylor exploded for 49.60 points to outperform projections by 26.21, lifting Limeira Dead Rabbits to a 19.30-point win. He recorded 244 rushing yards as part of his signature performance (244 Rsh Yds, 42 Rec Yds, 3 TD). He also recorded the highest point total in the league this season. The result might have been even worse as Limeira Dead Rabbits had a starter score zero points (Marvin Mims Jr.). Limeira Dead Rabbits (7-3, 1,188.90 points) remains in fifth place, while Indaiatuba Blues (6-4, 1,057.34 points) stays in seventh place.

 Emari Demercado really deserved more touches for Indaiatuba Blues, as he put up a whopping 104 total yards on just seven touches.

 While Justin Herbert led Limeira Dead Rabbits matches (with 27.70 points), Taylor has now been the team's top scorer in four of the past five weeks.

### Niners BH Beats Holambra Dutch, Deepens Losing Streak Frustration 

Niners BH beat Holambra Dutch, who labored to score points this week, 99.10 to 25.10. Niners BH took an 11.20-point lead on Thursday and maintained an advantage throughout the matchup. Holambra Dutch has no more answers, and doesn't have a win yet. Adding insult to injury, Holambra Dutch had five starters put up zeroes. Niners BH (2-8, 941.46 points) remains in 13th place and Holambra Dutch (0-10, 773.48 points) stays locked in last place.

 Ashton Jeanty had plenty of chances for Niners BH, but he logged just 63 total yards on 22 touches.

 While Ashton Jeanty led Niners BH with 19.90 points in Week 9, Johnson paced the squad this week with 20.20. Also, with nine targets this week for Khalil Shakir, it means that his targets have now increased in three consecutive games.

 In Week 11, Niners BH will face first-place Paulinia Robots (10-0, 1,295.34). Holambra Dutch will take on Barao Butchers (1-9, 866.44).
