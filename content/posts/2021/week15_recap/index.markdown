## Matchups Recap

### With Their Stars Coming Up Big, Paulinia Robots Moves to Semifinals 

Carried by the triple threat of Tyreek Hill, Brandin Cooks, and Antonio Gibson, Paulinia Robots overwhelmed Limeira Jetsons 138.48 to 88.32. That threesome combined to tally 80.50 points, clearly outperforming Aaron Rodgers, Sony Michel, and Stefon Diggs (50.82 combined points), the top three on Limeira Jetsons. Cooks scored two touchdowns, accumulating 29.20 points (102 Rec Yds, 2 TD). Hill also came through with 32.80 points (148 Rec Yds, 1 TD), while Gibson helped out with 18.50 points (26 Rsh Yds, 39 Rec Yds, 1 TD). With 138.48 points, Paulinia Robots had the best total in the league this week. Adding insult to injury, Limeira Jetsons got zero points from Zane Gonzalez.

 There was a player on both teams that had plenty of chances but left some points out on the field. On the winning side, Antonio Gibson got 21 touches but only tallied 65 total yards, while Joe Mixon managed just 60 yards on 18 touches for Limeira Jetsons.

 Paulinia Robots was ahead of the curve with their wideouts, as they started two of the league's top-10 overall WRs this week (including Hill, who was in the top five).

 For the winning side, a couple of players have been getting hot at the right time: the Miami Dolphins DEF and D'Onta Foreman. Over the past four fantasy matchups, that duo has outperformed their season scoring averages by 47% and 33%, respectively. On the other hand, Paulinia Robots has a player moving in the wrong direction. Kyler Murray has substantially underperformed his year-to-date average recently. Despite the loss, Limeira Jetsons had several players peaking for the postseason, including Michel and Zach Ertz. Over the past month, that combo has averaged 11.70 and 13.35 points, respectively, topping their season-long marks by 74% and 36%. Conversely, the losers had a player who was fading down the stretch. Amari Cooper has dipped below his yearly average by 56% over the past month.

 Going hand-in-hand with a rough patch to end the regular season, Paulinia Robots snuck into the final playoff spot. They advance to the semifinals where they will face No. 2-seeded Limeira Dead Rabbits, who is coming off a bye week. These teams last met in Week 11, with Limeira Dead Rabbits winning, 140.72 to 99.88. Limeira Jetsons finished the regular season in third place with a record of 9-5. Perhaps benefiting from some good fortune, they ranked just seventh in the league in scoring average at 109.06 points per game. Limeira Jetsons was sent home quickly this postseason, losing in their first playoff matchup.

 For the victors, two players have been getting hot at the right time: Gage and Dallas Goedert. Over the past four weeks, that duo has exceeded their season scoring averages by 69% and 45%, respectively. On the other hand, Barao Butchers has a pair of players heading in the opposite direction. The Buffalo Bills DEF and Najee Harris have both substantially underperformed their year-to-date averages recently.

London Knights started one player with zero points while Indaiatuba Blues also served up one goose egg, meaning both teams left points off the scoreboard.

 For the winning side, Mark Andrews is warming up at the right time. Over the past four weeks, he has outperformed his season scoring average by 40%. Conversely, London Knights has a player trending in the wrong direction, as Ja'Marr Chase has fallen significantly short of his year-to-date average recently. Indaiatuba Blues had a few players who were fading down the stretch, most notably Mark Ingram and Terry McLaurin. Over the past month, that combo has averaged 1.85 and 5.35 points, respectively, falling short of their season-long marks by 78% and 60%.
